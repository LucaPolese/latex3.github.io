# LaTeX, LaTeX3 and expl3 Logos and Usage

We’ve put together some assets for those times when you want to show
off your work as being produced by LaTeX, or link back to us. Happy
typesetting!

We are happy to thank [Paulo Cereda](https://github.com/cereda) for
designing and implementing the "hummingbird" logo for LaTeX.

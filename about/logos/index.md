# LaTeX, LaTeX3 and expl3 Logos and Usage

We’ve put together some assets for those times when you want to show
off your work as being produced by LaTeX, or link back to us. Happy
typesetting!

We are happy to thank [Paulo Cereda](https://github.com/cereda) for
designing and implementing the "hummingbird" logo for LaTeX.

    <h2>Please avoid misrepresentation ...</h2>
    <ul>
   
  <li>Please avoid when naming or describing <em>your projects or
  products</em> anything that implies endorsement by The LaTeX Team unless we have
  explicitly authorized this</li>
    
  <li>In particular, please refrain from using the term "The LaTeX
  Team" or the LaTeX logos except when you are referring
  directly to us or to the software produced by us</li>

  <li>Other usages are likely to imply that
  your product is in some way directly or indirectly related
  to us</li>

    <li> you want to use these images for a purpose not listed, or
    listed as undesirable, on this page</li>
    
    <li> you want to base your own logo on these images</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>In summary </h2>
    
    <p>In short, the LaTeX logos (with the hummingbird or the head of
    the hummingbird) represent only the work by "The LaTeX Team"
    and should not be used to represent <em>your products,
    organisation or services</em>.</p>
  </div>
</div>



<h2> LaTeX logos used within normal text</h2>

<p>In a document produced by LaTeX you can generate the textual form
of the LaTeX logo by simply using commands like
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\LaTeX{}</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\LaTeXe{}</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\LaTeX3</code> for the different textual logos.</p>

<p>Please use the ASCII form of these logos which are
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX2e</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX3</code>
in case the document is produced with software that
cannot correctly raise and lower characters.</p>

<p>Please do <em>not</em> use other forms of capitalizations,
e.g.,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LATEX</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">latex</code> would be incorrect!</p>

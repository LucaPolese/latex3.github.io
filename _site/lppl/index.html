<h1 id="current-version-of-the-lppl">Current version of the LPPL</h1>

<p>The LaTeX project public license is a <a href="https://www.debian.org/intro/free">free software</a> license. The most recent version of the LPPL is version 1.3c. The latest version, in plain text, can always be found at <a href="/lppl.txt">https://latex-project.org/lppl.txt</a>. There is also a LaTeX version of the license, which authors of LPPL software are encouraged to include in their manuals.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-lppl">How to use the LPPL</h2>

<p>To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and/or last substantially modified. Include also a statement that the distribution and/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license.</p>

<p>Here is an example of such a notice and statement: </p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">%% pig.dtx
%% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
%
% This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
% conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
% of this license or (at your option) any later version.
% The latest version of this license is in
%   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
% and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
% version 2005/12/01 or later.
%
% This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
% 
% The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
%
% This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
% and the derived file pig.sty.</code></pre></figure>

<p>Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `Work’ referring to the three files `pig.dtx’, `pig.ins’, and `pig.sty’ (the last being generated from `pig.dtx’ using `pig.ins’), the `Base Interpreter’ referring to any `LaTeX-Format’, and both `Copyright Holder’ and `Current Maintainer’ referring to the person `M. Y. Name’.</p>

<h2 id="versions-of-the-lppl">Versions of the LPPL</h2>

<p><strong>Version 1.3c should be used for all new works distributed under the LPPL</strong>.</p>

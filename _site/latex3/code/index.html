<h1 id="latex-development-code">LaTeX Development Code</h1>

<p>The base files of LaTeX are managed and developed in a number of GitHub repositories.
The most important ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex2e"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">latex2e</code></a> — the core LaTeX
format and base package (what you get running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdflatex</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lualatex</code>, etc.)
    <ul>
      <li>This repository also contains the required bundles, i.e.,
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amsmath</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">graphics</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tools</code> and for historical reasons <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cyrillic</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex3"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">latex3</code></a> — the L3 programming
layer and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3backend</code> (as integrated 2020 in the LaTeX format).
    <ul>
      <li>This repository also contains new code bundles for other components of LaTeX
 that are not yet integrated, because they are still under development.
 However, most of it is available through general TeX distributions
 in form of LaTeX packages and we clearly distinguish between
 experimental code (for the daring) and packages that we consider suitable for
 general use.</li>
      <li>More information about the packages included
in the repository is documented in the top-level
<a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex3/blob/master/README.md">README</a> of
the repository.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/latex3/">various other repositories</a>,
e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">babel</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hyperref</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3build</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">luaotfload</code> to mention a few,
all of which are managed by the LaTeX Project Team. In addition
several members have their own repositories from which they distribute
further LaTeX packages that are in general use.</p>

<h2 id="l3build">l3build</h2>

<p>The LaTeX code is installed and tested using
<a href="https://github.com/latex3/l3build"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3build</code></a> configuration
files. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3build</code> is a cross-platform Lua program for automating the
building and testing process of (primarily) LaTeX package files, and
it is also developed by the LaTeX team.</p>

<h2 id="obtaining-it">Obtaining it</h2>

<p>Most of the LaTeX code is directly available and automatically kept
up-to-date through all major TeX distributions so you <em>just</em> get it
automatically (or manually) through the update mechanism of your
installation.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility to run the version for the next release
using the so-called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-dev</code> formats which are curated prereleases
(that we believe are suitable for use and testing)</p>

<p>However, if you wish to test the unreleased development code on GitHub,
you may clone one of the repository using for example</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone git@github.com:latex3/latex3.git
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To locally install packages from the development repository, use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3build</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd l3kernel
l3build install
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In some cases (for example for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3kernel</code> because this is the L3
programming layer so is loaded into the format) you may need to update
the formats afterwards, but in most cases the local install is
sufficient.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Important note:</strong> Files installed via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3build install</code> are stored
 in your local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">texmf</code> tree, which is searched first when the
 TeX program looks for files. Thus later updates that you receive
 through the normal distribution mechanism will never get used,
 unless you delete the local files or set up you system so that you
 can switch trees as needed!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may alternatively wish to ‘fork’ the repository on GitHub and clone
your fork if you wish to make changes to the code and contribute them
back via Pull Requests but please read the <a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">LaTeX contributing
guidelines</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex3/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">L3 contributing
guidelines</a>
first.</p>

<h2 id="bug-reports">Bug reports</h2>

<p>You may raise any issues concerning the LaTeX format code or the core
packages in the <a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues">LaTeX2e Issue
Tracker</a>.  Please read the
explanation on <a href="/bugs/">how and when to raise a bug
report</a> first.  In order to be able to do a
decent job, we need your help in providing the right kind of
information when submitting a bug report — thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Bugs directly related to the L3 programming layer or bugs about L3
code that is not integrated in the LaTeX format are better raised in
the <a href="https://github.com/latex3/latex3/issues">L3 Issue Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>Issues opened are usually intended to report issues relating to the
code, such as documentation clarifications, missed functionality, or
bugs. Please do not use the issue trackers to request help with your
documents. Other channels such as <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com">stackexchange</a>
are much better suited for obtaining help.</p>

<h2 id="discussing-it">Discussing it</h2>

<p>The concepts developed by the LaTeX development code, as well as their implementation, are under discussion on the mailing list ‘LATEX-L’. You can join this list, which is intended solely for discussing ideas and concepts for future versions of LaTeX, by sending mail to <a href="mailto:listserv@URZ.UNI-HEIDELBERG.DE">listserv@URZ.UNI-HEIDELBERG.DE</a> containing the line</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>SUBSCRIBE LATEX-L Your Name
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="listserv-web-interface">Listserv web interface</h3>

<p>There exists a <a href="https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L">web interface to the
list</a> that
can be used to read through the posts sorted by topic and month. By
default this is available to the general public in a read-only
mode. If you would like to post using this interface, you have to be
subscribed to the list and you need to log on (which is an option on
the page).</p>

<h4 id="archived-posts">Archived posts</h4>

<p>This list is archived and, after subscription, you can retrieve older posts to it by sending mail to the above address, containing a command such as:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET LATEX-L LOGyymm
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where yy=Year and mm=Month, e.g.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>GET LATEX-L LOG1703
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>for all messages sent in March 2017.</p>

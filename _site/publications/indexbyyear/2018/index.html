</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the fundamentals of both the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fontspec</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">unicode-math</code> packages
have stayed the same, these packages have undergone a significant
amount of development behind the scenes. While many users won’t
be interested in the technical details, there are a number of feature
additions that deserve broader discussion.</p>

  <p>In this presentation I will cover the basics of these packages and best
practices for using them, specifically including more recent features
that users may not yet have seen. I will also try to give an overview of
some technical details to focus on <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> package development and
lessons learned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this talk I take a look at the major disruptions that have rocked the
LaTeX world in the past decades and how we handled them, covering
some of the resulting consequences.</p>

  <p>In the latest part of this saga a rollback concept for the LaTeX
kernel was introduced (around 2015).  Providing this feature allowed
us to make corrections to the software (which more or less didn’t
happen for nearly two decades) while continuing to maintain backward
compatibility to the highest degree.</p>

  <p>I will give some explanation on how we have now extended this concept to
the world of packages and classes which was not covered
initially. As the classes and the extension packages have different
requirements compared to the kernel, the approach is different (and
simplified). This should make it easy for package developers to
apply it to their packages and authors to use when necessary.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The LaTeX3 programming language, <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code>, has grown over the past
decade to form a strong and stable environment for solving problems in
TeX. A key aim is to grow this work to cover a wider range of areas. In
recent work, the team have been building on the existing code, and in
particular the expandable FPU, to develop approaches to color,
drawing and image support.  In this talk, I will look at why this work
is useful, what models we can work from and where the work has taken us
so far.</p>

  <li>Abstract:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this presentation I will outline the system by which I produce PDF
and HTML versions of course material for the honours project students in
the School of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Adelaide.</p>

  <p>This course material is broad and relatively dynamic in that it needs
both frequent and periodic updates, and there is a soft need to have it
available in a single document PDF and a hyperlinked HTML version. There
are a number of tools to perform such a task, and LaTeXML was chosen for
its robustness and relative simplicity. Nonetheless, the processing
phase does involve some regexps to clean up the resulting HTML, which is
not ideal from a maintenance perspective.</p>

  <p>On the back end, this project could not have been accomplished without
the API provided by the Learning Management System that we use, Canvas
by Instructure. The web API allows HTML pages to be updated from the
command line as well as PDF files to be automatically uploaded.</p>

  <p>This system allows me to have a single source for the documentation for
the course and makes updates almost entirely friction-free. While still
cobbled together from a number of technologies (largely <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> and shell
scripts), it provides an interface that could be expanded for more
general use.</p>

  <p>In the future, as well as re-writing the code in Lua for cross-platform
functionality, I also plan to overcome the problems involving use of
embedded graphics with text, and mathematical content in general.</p>

  <li>Abstract:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Testing has been important to the LaTeX team since its inception, and
over the years a sophisticated set of test files have been created for
the kernel.  Methods for running the tests have varied over the past
quarter-century, following changes in the way the team work.</p>

  <p>In recent years, the availability of Lua as a scripting language in all
TeX systems has meant it has become the natural choice to support this
work. With this as a driver, the team have developed <code class="highlighter-rouge">l3build</code> for
running tests automatically. Building on the core work, <code class="highlighter-rouge">l3build</code>
has grown to provide a powerful approach to releasing packages (and the
LaTeX kernel) reliably.</p>

  <p>Here, I’ll look at the background of our testing approach, before showing
how and why Lua works for ushere.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The dashundergaps package offers the possibility to replace material
in running text with white space in order to build up forms that can
be filled in at a later time.</p>

      <p>By default the gaps are underlined and followed by a gap number in
parentheses, but many other designs are possible, e.g., dashes or
dots instead of the underline, no gap numbers or a different format
for them, gap widening for easier fill-in, etc.  There is also a
teacher’s mode which shows the normally hidden text in a special
(customizable) format.</p>

      <p>This is another article in a series of TUGboat articles describing

    <blockquote>
      <p>The widows-and-orphans package checks page or column breaks for
issues with widow or orphan lines and issues warnings if such
problems are detected. In addition, it checks and complains about
breaks involving hyphenated words and warns about display formulas
directly after a page break —– if they are allowed by the document
parameter settings, which by default isn’t the case.</p>

<p>This article discusses the typographical problem of widows and
orphans, i.e., first and last lines of a paragraph that due to a page
break are separated from the rest of the paragraph.</p>

<p>Practical advice is given how to best avoid these situations and how
to manage and resolve them when they arise.  The final part discusses
the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">widows-and-orphans</code> that will help here by automatically
identifying and highlighting the problematical place in a longer
document, in fact not just for widows and orphans but also for words
hyphenated across a page break or math displays that got separated
from their preceding paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this talk I take a look at the major disruptions that have rocked the
LaTeX world in the past decades and how we handled them, covering
some of the resulting consequences.</p>

  <p>In the latest part of this saga a rollback concept for the LaTeX
kernel was introduced (around 2015).  Providing this feature allowed
us to make corrections to the software (which more or less didn’t
happen for nearly two decades) while continuing to maintain backward
compatibility to the highest degree.</p>

  <p>I will give some explanation on how we have now extended this concept to
the world of packages and classes which was not covered
initially. As the classes and the extension packages have different
requirements compared to the kernel, the approach is different (and

  <li>Abstract:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this presentation I will outline the system by which I produce PDF
and HTML versions of course material for the honours project students in
the School of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Adelaide.</p>

  <p>This course material is broad and relatively dynamic in that it needs
both frequent and periodic updates, and there is a soft need to have it
available in a single document PDF and a hyperlinked HTML version. There
are a number of tools to perform such a task, and LaTeXML was chosen for
its robustness and relative simplicity. Nonetheless, the processing
phase does involve some regexps to clean up the resulting HTML, which is
not ideal from a maintenance perspective.</p>

  <p>On the back end, this project could not have been accomplished without
the API provided by the Learning Management System that we use, Canvas
by Instructure. The web API allows HTML pages to be updated from the
command line as well as PDF files to be automatically uploaded.</p>

  <p>This system allows me to have a single source for the documentation for
the course and makes updates almost entirely friction-free. While still
cobbled together from a number of technologies (largely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> and shell
scripts), it provides an interface that could be expanded for more
general use.</p>

  <p>In the future, as well as re-writing the code in Lua for cross-platform
functionality, I also plan to overcome the problems involving use of
embedded graphics with text, and mathematical content in general.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Testing has been important to the LaTeX team since its inception, and
over the years a sophisticated set of test files have been created for
the kernel.  Methods for running the tests have varied over the past
quarter-century, following changes in the way the team work.</p>

  <p>In recent years, the availability of Lua as a scripting language in all
TeX systems has meant it has become the natural choice to support this
work. With this as a driver, the team have developed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3build</code> for
running tests automatically. Building on the core work, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3build</code>
has grown to provide a powerful approach to releasing packages (and the
LaTeX kernel) reliably.</p>

  <p>Here, I’ll look at the background of our testing approach, before showing
how and why Lua works for ushere.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/team/#frank-mittelbach">Frank Mittelbach</a></li>
  <li>Paper submitted to the Computational Intelligence Journal (Wiley) in 2017, accepted January 2018</li>
  <li>Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Pagination problems deal with questions around transforming a source
text stream into a formatted document by dividing it up into
individual columns and pages, including adding auxiliary elements that
have some relationship to the source stream data but may allow a
certain amount of variation in placement (such as figures or
footnotes).</p>

      <p>Traditionally the pagination problem has been approached by separating
it into one of micro-typography (e.g., breaking text into paragraphs,
also known as h&amp;j) and one of macro-typography (e.g., taking a galley
of already formatted paragraphs and breaking them into columns and
pages) without much interaction between the two.</p>

      <p>While early solutions for both problem areas used simple greedy
algorithms, Knuth and Plass (1981) introduced in the ’80s a global-fit
algorithm for line breaking that optimizes the breaks across the whole
paragraph. This algorithm was implemented in TeX’82 (see Knuth (986b))
and has since kept its crown as the best available solution for this
space. However, for macro-typography there has been no (successful)
attempt to provide globally optimized page layout: All systems to date
(including TeX) use greedy algorithms for pagination. Various problems
in this area have been researched and the literature documents some
prototype development. But none of them have been made widely
available to the research community or ever made it into a generally
usable and publicly available system.</p>

      <p>This paper is an extended version of the work by Mittelbach (2016)
originally presented at the DocEng ’16 conference in Vienna. It
presents a framework for a global-fit algorithm for page breaking
based on the ideas of Knuth/Plass. It is implemented in such a way
that it is directly usable without additional executables with any
modern TeX installation. It therefore can serve as a test bed for
future experiments and extensions in this space. At the same time a
cleaned-up version of the current prototype has the potential to
become a production tool for the huge number of TeX users world-wide.</p>

      <p>The paper also discusses two already implemented extensions that
increase the flexibility of the pagination process (a necessary
prerequisite for successful global optimization): the ability to
automatically consider existing flexibility in paragraph length (by
considering paragraph variations with different numbers of lines) and
the concept of running the columns on a double spread a line long or
short. It concludes with a discussion of the overall approach, its
inherent limitations and directions for future research.</p>

<a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com">tex.stackexchange.com</a> to give a
flavor of the language and describe its possibilities. Topics include
list printing, string manipulation, macro creation, and graphics.</p>

  <h3><a href="/publications/">Publications by year</a></h3>
  <p>By selecting an entry in the table of contents you will find links
    to Portable Document Format (PDF) versions of various articles and
    papers published by the LaTeX3 project and links to videos of
    their conference presentations. Some of this list has been
    assembled 'after the fact'; please inform us if you notice
    anything missing.</p>
  <h3><a href="/publications/indexbytopic">Publications by topic</a></h3>
  <p>A different view is given on
    <a href="/publications/indexbytopic/">Publication by Topic page</a> where the Publications 
    are ordered by important topics.</p>
  <h3><a href="/help/books">Books by project members
      and others</a></h3>
  <p>A list of books that we think are useful is given on
    the <a href="/help/books">Books Page</a>. By
    buying documentation through this website you support the volunteer
    work of project members to keep LaTeX useful for you.</p>

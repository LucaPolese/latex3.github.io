<p>In 2012, a question “How to influence the float placement in LaTeX” was asked on TeX.stackexchange and as there had been many earlier questions around this topic I decided to treat the topic in some depth and explain most of the mysteries that the underlying mechanism poses to people trying to use it successfully. Once my answer appeared on the web, people asked to see this converted into an article and I foolishly replied “only if this answer ends up becoming a `great’ answer” (gets 100 votes). At the time of writing this article, the answer stands at 222 votes, so I had better make good on that promise.</p>

<p>Regression tests are an important tool in any moderately complex
programming environment. They allow the programmer to make extensive
changes to their code while providing confidence that something that
used to work still does. Extensive regression test suites have been an
essential component of the maintenance and development of LaTeX2e and
LaTeX3. A regression test suite is typically composed of a number of
individual files that contain one or more testable units of the code
being tested. A testable unit might be either a certain computation
with an expected outcome, a series of logic tests, or—in particular
for TeX-based code—material that is typeset and intended to achieve
some particular formatting. During code development and before any new
code is released to the public, this test suite can be compiled to
ensure that any changes to the code have not introduced bugs or
changed the behaviour compared to previous versions. As bugs in the
code are reported, minimal examples demonstrating the bug often form
test files of their own, showing that the bug has been fixed and won’t
re-occur. As TeX-based code operates in at least three different
`modes’ (mouth, stomach, and output), regression testing is more
complex than simply asserting the outcome of certain programming
logic. As part of the work of the LaTeX3 project, a new Lua-based
testing environment has been written to support ongoing
development. This testing environment, presented at the 2014 TUG
conference in Portland, is suitable for use by the general TeX
community.</p>

<h3 id="a-hrefhttpswwww3orgtrmathml3-targetblankmathematical-markup-language-mathml-version-30-2nd-editiona"><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/MathML3/" target="_blank">Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) Version 3.0 2nd Edition</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/team/#david-carlisle">David Carlisle</a> (editor)</li>
  <li>W3C Recommendation, 10 April 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>This specification defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML. MathML is a markup language for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.</p>

<p>This specification of the markup language MathML is intended primarily for a readership consisting of those who will be developing or implementing renderers or editors using it, or software that will communicate using MathML as a protocol for input or output. It is not a User’s Guide but rather a reference document.</p>

<p>MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content. About thirty-eight of the MathML tags describe abstract notational structures, while another about one hundred and seventy provide a way of unambiguously specifying the intended meaning of an expression. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of special characters used for mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode, and their relation to fonts.</p>

<p>While MathML is human-readable, authors typically will use equation editors, conversion programs, and other specialized software tools to generate MathML. Several versions of such MathML tools exist, both freely available software and commercial products, and more are under development.</p>

<p>MathML was originally specified as an XML application and most of the examples in this specification assume that syntax. Other syntaxes are possible most notably [HTML5] specifies the syntax for MathML in HTML. Unless explictly noted, the examples in this specification are also valid HTML syntax.</p>

  <li><a href="/about/team/#david-carlisle">David Carlisle</a> (editor)</li>
  <li>W3C Recommendation, 10 April 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>This document defines several sets of names, so that to each name is assigned a Unicode character or sequence of characters. Each of these sets is expressed as a file of XML entity declarations.</p>

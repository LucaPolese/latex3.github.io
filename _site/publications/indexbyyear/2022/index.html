  <li><a href="/about/team/#jospeh-wright">Joseph Wright</a></li>
  <li>TUGboat 43:2, 2022</li>
  <li>Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The concept of letters having case is familiar to speakers of several languages, most obviously those from Europe using Latin, Greek or Cyrillic scripts. The ability to convert between upper and lower case, case changing, is something we might take for granted both for people and for computer systems. However, there are subtleties that a careful implementation needs to take into account…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/team/#joseph-wright">Joseph Wright</a></li>
  <li>Video of the TUG 2022 online conference</li>
  <li>Keywords: LaTeX, key/value handling</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>

      <p>LaTeX2ε introduced class and package setting in the optional arguments to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\documentclass</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\usepackage</code>.
To date, these were designed to handle simple keyword-based option.
Over time, packages have extended the mechanism to accept key-value (keyval) arguments.
Recent work by the team brings keyval handling into the kernel.
This brings the added benefit of allowing repeated package loading to avoid clashes.
Here, I will look briefly at the background, then explore how to use the new mechanism in package development.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/team/#joseph-wright">Joseph Wright</a></li>
  <li>Video of the TUG 2022 online conference</li>
  <li>Keywords: LaTeX, Unicode, case changing</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>

      <p>In 2015, I talked about my work exploring Unicode-land, particularly how to carry out case changing in XeTeX and LuaTeX properly. Since then, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> has become a part of the LaTeX kernel, and LaTeX has adopted UTF-8 as the standard input encoding.  The time has therefore become ripe to “open up” Unicode-land to allow MakeUppercase and MakeLowercase to roam free.  In this talk, I’ll remind us of what Unicode tells us about case changing, where the challenges are and how we’ve approached them in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expl3</code>. I’ll then show how this has combined with some *TeX features to enable us to make the switch, incorporate ideas from the textcase package and upgrade MakeUppercase and MakeLowercase for the 21st century.</p>

    <blockquote>

      <p>Since it was first released in 2008, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">siunitx</code> has become established as the major package for typesetting physical quantities in LaTeX. Following up on my TUG 2018 talk, I will look at how the update to version 3 has gone now that this is out. I’ll briefly look at the background, then consider some of the user and developer efforts that have made the launch a success.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/team/#jospeh-wright">Joseph Wright</a></li>
  <li>TUGboat 43:1, 2022</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>
      <p>For package authors, creating a release is a regular process, ideal for automation. There are several steps to creating a release to CTAN, for example ensuring documentation is updated, structuring an archive correctly and actually uploading the material.</p>

      <p>A Some time ago, the LaTeX Team extended their existing basic scripts to create an independent tool, l3build, which can cover all of those tasks. Most significantly, it included features to run comprehensive tests: this aspect was previously covered for TUGboat (2014, 35:3, pp. 287–293). Here, I will give a more general overview of the tool, looking at how it can help package authors create releases in a quick and reliable manner.</p>

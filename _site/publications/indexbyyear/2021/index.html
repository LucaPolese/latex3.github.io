  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this article I present two packages as part of the LaTeX Project’s “Tagged PDF” effort:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>tagpdf</em> which contains the core code to create a tagged PDF and is used by the LaTeX team to test new code.</li>
        <li><em>pdfmanagement-testphase</em> which contains a large number of PDF-related commands and tools and installs a new management command for central PDF dictionaries.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I will show how to use these packages and the benefits they will bring for the average user, while also mentioning resulting incompatibilities and required changes in documents.</p>

  <li>Video of the TUG 2021 online conference</li>
  <li>Keywords: LaTeX, tagging, paragraph  handling</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this talk I demonstrate and describe our solution for automatically tagging paragraphs when using engines such as pdfTeX or XeTeX. The situation with LuaTeX is different, and simpler, and therefore not the subject of this talk. I briefly touch on the problems one encounters and explain the approaches we used to overcome them. This will be done with a number of demonstrations intermixed with theoretical explanations.</p>

      <p>This work is part of our multi-year journey to gradually modernize LaTeX so that it can automatically produce high-quality tagged and “accessible” PDF without the need to post-process the result of the LaTeX run.</p>

  <li>Video of the TUG 2021 online conference</li>
  <li>Keywords: LaTeX, color handling</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>
      <p>TeX itself has no built-in support for colour, which is therefore handled by specials or engine-specific extensions. For LaTeX 2ε , the different interfaces are abstracted out by the color package. However, there is a lot that the color package does not do; for example, handling colour model interconversion, mixing colours or device-specific colour spaces. Packages such as xcolor and colorspace fill that gap, whilst the luacolor package addresses a separate issue: avoiding the need to use whatsits for colour at all.</p>

      <p>As part of wider efforts to enhance the LaTeX kernel via expl3 additions, recent work on the l3color package has brought many of these concepts into a single set of interfaces. That means not only copying existing ideas but also ensuring maximal functionality. In my talk, I will explore the work on l3color, highlighting where it can go beyond the predecessor packages in ease of use and functionality.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/team/#marcel-krueger">Marcel Krüger</a></li>
  <li>Video of the TUG 2021 online conference</li>
  <li>Keywords: Type3 fonts</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>
      <p>For a long time, Type 3 fonts in LaTeX-generated PDF files were known for (undesirable) bitmap fonts, but that’s only a small aspect of what this font format can do. With OpenType color fonts, the idea behind Type 3 fonts has seen a revival, and LuaTeX recently added support for adding such fonts for non-bitmap use cases too.</p>

      <p>In this talk I want to look at how this format can be used to create smaller and simpler PDF files involving color fonts and user-generated glyphs and consider advantages and disadvantages in contrast to traditional alternatives like virtual fonts or macrobased solutions.</p>

  <li><a href="/about/team/#jospeh-wright">Joseph Wright</a></li>
  <li>TUGboat 42:1, 2021</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>
      <p>Creating document commands in LaTeX has traditionally involved a mix of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\newcommand</code>, semi-internal kernel commands (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\@ifnextchar</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\@ifstar</code>) and low-level TeX programming using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\def</code>. As part of wider efforts to improve LaTeX, the team have over the past few years developed ideas for creating document commands in the package xparse. In a parallel article (on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\NewDocumentCommand</code>, on the following pages), I’ve looked at how the xparse ideas compare to the abilities of other packages.</p>

  <li><a href="/about/team/#jospeh-wright">Joseph Wright</a></li>
  <li>TUGboat 42:1, 2021</li>
  <li>Abstract
    <blockquote>
      <p>Creating new document commands in LaTeX has traditionally been the job of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\newcommand</code>. This lets you create a command with mandatory arguments, and also support a first optional argument. However, it can’t create more complex commands: LaTeX uses stars, multiple optional arguments, and plenty more. To define commands using such syntaxes, the kernel itself uses lower-level TeX programming. But this is opaque to many users, and a variety of packages have been created to ease the burden. …</p>

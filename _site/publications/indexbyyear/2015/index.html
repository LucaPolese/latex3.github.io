<ul>
  <li><a href="/about/team/#frank-mittelbach">Frank Mittelbach</a></li>
  <li>Published paper, TUGboat volume 36, number 1, 2015</li>
  <li>Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>This article discusses certain aspects of TeX’s approach to line
breaking and its consequences for automatically calculating the
right amount of vertical space between lines in more complex layouts.</p>

      <p>It starts with giving a short introduction to the box-glue-penalty
algebra used by TeX to model material to typeset. We then look at
how the program calculates the vertical glue between lines in which
the parameter \prevdepth plays a crucial role. Next we examine
different types of output routines and evaluate how and to what extent
the TeX algorithms can accommodate their goals.</p>

      <p>The final conclusion is that this is an area where we can pose
problems that cannot be resolved using current TeX, ε-TeX, pdfTeX,
or XeTeX, unless you restrict the allowable input, as there is no
way to obtain some of the information used by TeX’s algorithms for
later manipulation of the result.</p>

      <p>Like the answer to many questions these days, the situation is
(probably) different with LuaTeX — probably, because I haven’t
actually tried it, but given the additional possibilities offered by
LuaTeX a solution should be feasible.</p>

  <li>Abstract:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Pagination problems deal with questions around transforming a source
text stream into a formatted document by dividing it up into
individual columns and pages, including adding auxiliary elements that
have some relationship to the source stream data but may allow a
certain amount of variation in placement (such as figures or
footnotes).</p>

      <p>Traditionally the pagination problem has been approached by separating
it into one of micro-typography (e.g., breaking text into paragraphs,
also known as h&amp;j) and one of macro-typography (e.g., taking a galley
of already formatted paragraphs and breaking them into columns and
pages) without much interaction between the two.</p>

      <p>While early solutions for both problem areas used simple greedy
algorithms, Knuth and Plass (1981) introduced in the ’80s a global-fit
algorithm for line breaking that optimizes the breaks across the whole
paragraph. This algorithm was implemented in TeX’82 (see Knuth (986b))
and has since kept its crown as the best available solution for this
space. However, for macro-typography there has been no (successful)
attempt to provide globally optimized page layout: All systems to date
(including TeX) use greedy algorithms for pagination. Various problems
in this area have been researched and the literature documents some
prototype development. But none of them have been made widely
available to the research community or ever made it into a generally
usable and publicly available system.</p>

      <p>This paper is an extended version of the work by Mittelbach (2016)
originally presented at the DocEng ’16 conference in Vienna. It
presents a framework for a global-fit algorithm for page breaking
based on the ideas of Knuth/Plass. It is implemented in such a way
that it is directly usable without additional executables with any
modern TeX installation. It therefore can serve as a test bed for
future experiments and extensions in this space. At the same time a
cleaned-up version of the current prototype has the potential to
become a production tool for the huge number of TeX users world-wide.</p>

      <p>The paper also discusses two already implemented extensions that
increase the flexibility of the pagination process (a necessary
prerequisite for successful global optimization): the ability to
automatically consider existing flexibility in paragraph length (by
considering paragraph variations with different numbers of lines) and
the concept of running the columns on a double spread a line long or
short. It concludes with a discussion of the overall approach, its
inherent limitations and directions for future research.</p>

<p>This paper presents an extension to the general framework for globally
optimized pagination described in Mittelbach (2016). The extended
algorithm supports automatic placement of floats as part of the
optimization. It uses a flexible constraint model that allows for the
implementation of typical typographic rules that can be weighted
against each other to support different application scenarios.</p>

<p>Continuing the quest for automatically finding optimal pagination of
documents the journey takes us now to the fairy land of
 objective functions,
 call-out constraints,
 layout templates and
 other mystical creatures
and a Queen that cries “Faster! Faster!” because “… it takes all the
running YOU can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get
somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”
This talk explores how fast we must ran to enter that world.</p>

<p>In this talk a framework for globally optimizing pagination of
documents containing floats is demonstrated. As the main example Alice
in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was chosen. If such a document is
formatted using standard LaTeX it will result in a

<p>This paper presents an algorithm for globally optimized pagination
using dynamic programming and discusses its theoretical background. It was
awarded the “ACM Best Paper Award” at the DocEng 2016 conference. The
paper is the basis for the work demonstrated at BachoTek and
TUG 2016 (the order is reversed as submission deadline for DocEng was
already in March but the conference was in September).</p>

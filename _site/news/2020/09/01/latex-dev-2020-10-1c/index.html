    <h1 id="the-third-and-final-latex-pre-release-for-2020-10-01-is-available-for-testing">The third and final LaTeX pre-release for 2020-10-01 is available for testing</h1>

<p>A few days ago we submitted a new LaTeX development format<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to CTAN
and by now this should be available to all users using MiKTeX or TeX
Live (on any operating system).</p>

<h2 id="main-features-of-the-final-pre-release-for-2020-10-01">Main features of the final pre-release for 2020-10-01</h2>

<p>In the previous pre-releases, distributed in May and July, the following main
features (besides bug fixes) were made available:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The functionality of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xparse</code> package was added directly to the LaTeX kernel.</li>
  <li>LaTeX’s font series handling was improved.</li>
  <li>A general hook management system was added to improve package
interoperability and enable easier customization.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this final prerelease we have fully integrated the hook management
system (previously it was added at the end, overwriting earlier
definitions in the kernel). In addition the following features were added:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The picture environent now supports dimensions (and not only
numbers multiplied by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\unitlength</code>) in places where coordinates
have to be specified. This is basically incorporating into the kernel
the functionality of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">picture.sty</code> package by Heiko Oberdiek.</li>
  <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\ShowCommand</code> was added to show the definition of robust
commands in an easy manner.</li>
  <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\NewCommandCopy</code> was added to allow making copies of robust
commands (which can’t be done using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\let</code>).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docstrip</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l3docstrip</code> were merged so that one can now always
use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docstrip</code> even with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expl3</code>-based sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-fixes-and-improvements">Other fixes and improvements</h3>

<p>There have been a larger number of smaller bug fixes and enhancements.
A full list of all fixes and additions is given in a draft version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ltnews32</code>,
which you should be able to read by running</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>texdoc ltnews32
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>on the command line (or by any other means available with your operating
system—somewhere there should be a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ltnews32.pdf</code> that
you can open with a PDF reader). The draft version of this file is also available from our website as
<a href="/news/latex2e-news/ltnews32.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="vgwPixelCall('4c0ec6a7a0884b70986328bd5dc816ee');">LaTeX2e News Issue 32 draft</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-general-hook-management-system-for-latex-the-main-feature-of-the-2020-fall-release">A general hook management system for LaTeX (the main feature of the 2020 fall release)</h3>

<p>Most LaTeX users and package writers will know the handful of hooks
that LaTeX has been offering until now, the most important one perhaps
being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\AtBeginDocument</code>. These are important hooks, but they are far
too few so that in many cases package developers had to directly patch
the internals of LaTeX.  This resulted in many problems.</p>

<p>With the new hook management system, LaTeX will get many more hooks
that packages writers (and authors) can use to add code in a
controlled and reliable way.  New hooks have been added in a number of
places by using the new system and more will follow over
time. Available now are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hooks to add code before and after environments (formerly offered
through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">etoolbox</code> package);</li>
  <li>Hooks used when loading files, packages, or classes (similar to
what the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filehook</code> package now provides);</li>
  <li>Hooks in the page-building process (e.g., functionality previously
available through packages such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atbegshi</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atveryend</code> and a
few others).</li>
</ul>

<p>The important point here is not so much that the functionality of these
packages has been integrated into the LaTeX kernel, but that the
hook management system provides a single structured way for different packages 
to reliably add and order 
code.  This will resolve
many of the inter-package interoperability issues which formerly
could be resolved (if at all) only by loading the packages in a specific order, 
or by the use of complex and fragile code inside the packages to account
for various scenarios in user documents.</p>

<p>The hook management system is currently described in these three documents:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">texdoc lthooks</code>  — The description of the interfaces and the core
hooks already added to the kernel.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">texdoc ltshipout</code> — The documentation of the hooks available
during the page production process.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">texdoc ltfilehook</code> — hooks that can be used before or after a file gets loaded.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outlook">Outlook</h2>

<p>We expect this to be the final pre-release matching the code that goes
into the 2020-10-01 release, except for any bug fixes that are found
between now and the release date.</p>

<h2 id="please-help-with-the-testing">Please help with the testing</h2>

<p>We are issuing this final pre-release now in the hope that you will help us by
making sure that all the enhancements and fixes we have provided are safe and that
they do not have any undesired side effects, so please help with the testing if
you can.</p>

<p>This development format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-10-01 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven’t introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problems beforehand but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we are asking for user
testing.</p>

<p>Besides developers, we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release, because the more people that test the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release hits the streets.</p>

<p>Processing your documents with the pre-release is straightforward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-dev</code> to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>instead of using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pdflatex</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lualatex</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xelatex</code>. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straightforward.</p>

<p>Enjoy — Frank</p>

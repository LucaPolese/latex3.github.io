    <h1 id="the-first-latex-prerelease-for-2020-02-02-is-available-for-testing">The first LaTeX prerelease for 2020-02-02 is available for testing</h1>

<p>A few days ago we have submitted a new LaTeX development format to
CTAN and by now it should be available to all users using MikTeX or
TeX Live (on any operating system).</p>

<p>This format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-02-02 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven’t introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problem beforehand, but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we ask for user
testing.</p>

<p>Besides developers we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release candidate, because the more people are testing the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in February hits the streets.</p>

<p>Processing your documents with the prerelease is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
<code class="highlighter-rouge">-dev</code> to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>instead of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">pdflatex</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">lualatex</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">xelatex</code>. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.</p>

<h2 id="main-features-of-2020-02-02-prerelease-2">Main features of 2020-02-02 prerelease 2</h2>

<p>For technical reasons this first prerelease is labeled “prerelease 2”.
Prerelease 1 existed only for a few hours on CTAN, as it was missing
some files due to a problem in the build process, but because it was
already on CTAN we had to increase the prerelease number.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-luatex-engine-coming-up-">A new LuaTeX engine coming up …</h3>

<p>In TeXLive 2020 the LuaLaTeX format will always use the new LuaHBTeX
engine, which is LuaTeX with an embedded HarfBuzz library.
HarfBuzz can be used by setting a suitable renderer in the font
declaration. An interface for that is provided by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fontspec</code> package.
This additional font renderer will greatly improve the shaping of
various scripts, which are currently handled correctly only by
XeTeX.</p>

<p>To simplify the testing of the new engine, the necessary executables
have been added to MiKTeX and TeXLive 2019 and both have changed the
LuaLaTeX-dev format to use it. <em>This means you can already now test
the new engine by using the prerelease!</em></p>

<p>Even if you have no need for the new HarfBuzz functionality it might
be worthwhile running some tests, because, from 2020 onwards this will
be the only LuaTeX engine for which a LaTeX format will be distributed
in TeXLive and MikTeX from 2020 onwards.</p>

<h3 id="improved-load-times-for-expl3">Improved load-times for <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code></h3>

<p>The LaTeX3 programming layer, <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code>, has over the past decade moved
from being largely experimental to broadly stable. It is now used in a
significant number of third-party packages, either explicitly or
implicitly (e.g., by loading <code class="highlighter-rouge">xparse</code> to define user command
interfaces), so that many documents load the <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> code at some
point in the preamble. Most LaTeX documents compiled using XeTeX or
LuaTeX load <code class="highlighter-rouge">fontspec</code>, which is written using <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> so in these
engines it is nearly always used.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> layer contains a non-trivial number of macros, and when
used with the XeTeX and LuaTeX engines, it loads a large body of
Unicode data.  This means that even on a fast computer, there is a
relatively large load time penalty whenever <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> is needed.</p>

<p>For this release, the team have made adjustments in the LaTeX 2e kernel to
pre-load a significant portion of <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> when the format is built. This is
transparent at the user level, other than the significant decrease in document
processing time: there will be no “pause” for loading Unicode data
files. Loading of <code class="highlighter-rouge">expl3</code> in documents and packages can be done as usual;
it will, at some future time, become possible to omit</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>\RequirePackage{expl3}
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>entirely, but, to support older formats, this explicit loading is at
present still recommended.</p>

<h3 id="please-test-now--even-though-there-is-more-to-come">Please test now — even though there is more to come</h3>

<p>We ask you to test now, because (unless we made some mistakes) the
above changes should be transparent to the user — other than
speeding up the load process or allowing to handle complicated scripts
with LuaLaTeX that before would not work correctly.</p>

<p>Probably early January we expect to distribute another prerelease which
will most likely contain improvements to the font support for all engines.</p>

<h2 id="the-prereleases-will-never-go-stale-in-the-future-we-hope">The prereleases will never go stale in the future (we hope)</h2>

<p>Starting with this prerelease we will make sure that the prerelease
in the distributions either matches the main release code or will be
newer than the current main release. This was not the case in the last
few weeks when the main release was 2019-10-01 with a few hot fixes
added, but the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-dev</code> format was still from some day prior to October.</p>

<p>In the future we intend to ensure that this does not happen, so that,
to avoid confusion, the distributed development release is always
newer or the same as the current main release.</p>

<h2 id="more-details-on-prereleases-please-">More details on prereleases please …</h2>

<p>More details and some background information about these concepts and
the process of the development formats is available in a TUGboat

      <p>How do you prevent creating banana software (i.e., software that
gets ripe at the customer site)? By proper testing! But this is
anything but easy.</p>

      <p>The paper will give an overview of the efforts made by the LaTeX

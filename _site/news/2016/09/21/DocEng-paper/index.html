<p>At DocEng ‘16 the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering Frank
presented a paper on “A Framework for Globally Optimized Pagination”
that discusses an algorithm and its theoretical foundation for
globally optimized pagination using a dynamic programming
approach. The paper was awarded with the “ACM Best Paper Award” of the
conference.</p>

<p>The full paper can be downloaded from the ACM Digital library through a link on the <a href="/publications/">Publications
page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-of-the-paper">Abstract of the Paper</h3>

<p>Pagination problems deal with questions around transforming a source
text stream into a formatted document by dividing it up into
individual columns and pages, including adding auxiliary elements that
have some relationship to the source stream data but may allow a
certain amount of variation in placement (such as figures or
footnotes).</p>

<p>Traditionally the pagination problem has been approached by separating
it into one of micro-typography (e.g., breaking text into paragraphs,
also known as h&amp;j) and one of macro-typography (e.g., taking a galley
of already formatted paragraphs and breaking them into columns and
pages) without much interaction between the two.</p>

<p>While early solutions for both problem spaces used simple greedy
algorithms, Knuth and Plass introduced in the ’80s a global-fit
algorithm for line breaking that optimizes the breaks across the whole
paragraph [1]. This algorithm was implemented in TeX’82 [2] and has
since kept its crown as the best available solution for this
space. However, for macro-typography there has been no (successful)
attempt to provide globally optimized page layout: all systems to date
(including TeX) use greedy algorithms for pagination. Various problems
in this area have been researched (e.g., [3,4,5,6]) and the literature
documents some prototype development. But none of these prototypes
have been made widely available to the research community or ever made
it into a generally usable and publicly available system.</p>

<p>This paper presents a framework for a global-fit algorithm for page
breaking based on the ideas of Knuth/Plass. It is implemented in such
a way that it is directly usable without additional executables with
any modern TeX installation. It therefore can serve as a test bed for
future experiments and extensions in this space. At the same time a
cleaned-up version of the current prototype has the potential to
become a production tool for the huge number of TeX users world-wide.</p>

<p>The paper also discusses two already implemented extensions that
increase the flexibility of the pagination process: the ability to
automatically consider existing flexibility in paragraph length (by
considering paragraph variations with different numbers of lines [7])
and the concept of running the columns on a double spread a line long
or short. It concludes with a discussion of the overall approach, its
inherent limitations and directions for future research.</p>

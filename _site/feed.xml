        <title>Second pre-release of LaTeX 2020-10-01 is available for testing</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-second-latex-pre-release-for-2020-10-01-is-available-for-testing&quot;&gt;The second LaTeX pre-release for 2020-10-01 is available for testing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago we submitted a new LaTeX development format&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to CTAN
and by now this should be available to all users using MiKTeX or TeX
Live (on any operating system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-features-of-the-second-pre-release-for-2020-10-01&quot;&gt;Main features of the second pre-release for 2020-10-01&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first pre-release, distributed at the end of May, had the following two main
features (beside bug fixes):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the functionality of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt; package was added directly to the LaTeX kernel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LaTeX’s font series handling was improved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second pre-release adds one major new component to LaTeX: a general
hook management system to improve package interoperability and enable
easier customization and extension of LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-general-hook-management-system-for-latex&quot;&gt;A general hook management system for LaTeX&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most LaTeX users and package writers will know the handful of hooks
that LaTeX has been offering until now, the most important one perhaps
being &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\AtBeginDocument&lt;/code&gt;. These are important hooks, but they are far
too few so that in many cases package developers had to directly patch
the internals of LaTeX.  Thus resulted in many problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new hook management system, LaTeX will get many more hooks
that packages writers (and authors) can use to add code in a
controlled and reliable way.  New hooks have been added in a number of
places by using the new system and more will follow over
time. Available now are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hooks to add code before and after environments (formerly offered
through the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;etoolbox&lt;/code&gt; package);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hooks used when loading files, packages, or classes (similar to
what the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filehook&lt;/code&gt; package now provides);&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hooks in the page-building process (e.g., functionality previously
available through packages such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;atbegshi&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;atveryend&lt;/code&gt; and a
few others).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The importance here is not so much that the functionality of these
packages has been integrated into the LaTeX kernel, but that the
hook management system provides a single structured way for different packages 
to reliably add and order 
code.  This will resolve
many of the inter-package interoperability issues which formerly
could be resolved (if at all) only by loading the packages in a specific order, 
or by the use of complex and fragile code inside the packages to account
for various scenarios in user documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hook management system is currently described in these three documents
(for the final release they will be consolidated):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;texdoc lthooks&lt;/code&gt;  — The description of the interfaces and the core
hooks already added to the kernel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;texdoc ltshipout&lt;/code&gt; — The documentation of the hooks available
during the page production process.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;texdoc ltfilehook&lt;/code&gt; — hooks that can be used before or after a file gets loaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;other-fixes-and-improvements&quot;&gt;Other fixes and improvements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full list of all fixes and additions is given in a draft version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ltnews32&lt;/code&gt;
which you should be able to read by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;texdoc ltnews32
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the command line (or by any other means available at your operating
system—somewhere there should be a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ltnews32.pdf&lt;/code&gt; that
you can open with a PDF reader). The draft version of this file is also available from our website as
&lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/ltnews32.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('ae10a427f62847639c5aadcc05cea97b');&quot;&gt;LaTeX2e News Issue 32 draft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outlook&quot;&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect to produce a third and final pre-release incorporating the
user feedback we receive and consolidating some of the documentation.
A few additional outstanding issues are expected to get fixed as well,
but nothing major — the main functionality planned for the fall
release is available already now with the second pre-release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-help-with-the-testing&quot;&gt;Please help with the testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are issuing this second pre-release now in the hope that you will help us by
making sure that all the enhancements and fixes we have provided are safe and that
they do not have any undesired side effects, so please help with the testing if
you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This development format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-10-01 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven’t introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problems beforehand but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we are asking for user
testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides developers, we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release, because the more people that test the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in October hits the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing your documents with the pre-release is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pdflatex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lualatex&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xelatex&lt;/code&gt;. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy — Frank&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-articles-by-project-members&quot;&gt;New articles by project members&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have added five articles recently published in TUGboat to the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enrico discusses aspects of mathematical typesetting,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Frank’s article discusses a new package that implements an improved algorithm for float handling,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Joseph looks a case changing in the Unicode world and the LaTeX3 tools available,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ulrike’s article gives a sort overview about the work going on in providing tagged PDF documents and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ulrike and Marcel discuss the use of LuaLaTeX with Harfbuzz in a case study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find all of them on the &lt;a href=&quot;/publications/indexbyyear/2020/&quot;&gt;Publications from 2020&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Online TUG Conference 24-26 July 2020</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-first-online-tug-conference-will-happen-24-26-july-2020&quot;&gt;The first online TUG conference will happen 24-26 July 2020&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably heard this already from other sources and maybe already
registered, but if not, now is the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week the annual TeX Users Group Conference will be broadcast
live: to watch the presentations and otherwise participate all you
need to do is to &lt;a href=&quot;https://tug.org/tug2020/&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;. This year
registration is free of charge, because the costs for an online event
are much lower, so all that is needed to attend is the registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of people from the LaTeX Project Team are giving presentations:
Javier,
Joseph,
Marcel and myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find many interesting and exciting talks in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tug.org/tug2020/program.html&quot;&gt;the program
schedule&lt;/a&gt; and while some may be
at inconvenient hours, depending on your location, most are probably
at reasonable times. If not there are plans to make the talks
available afterwards (no details yet), but live or partly live events
are usually more fun in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tug.org/tug2020/&quot;&gt;register yourself&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested
and let’s make this the biggest TeX conference in years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy — Frank&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First prerelease of LaTeX 2020-10-01 is available for testing</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-first-latex-prerelease-for-2020-10-01-is-available-for-testing&quot;&gt;The first LaTeX prerelease for 2020-10-01 is available for testing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago we have submitted a new LaTeX development format&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to CTAN
and by now it should be available to all users using MiKTeX or TeX
Live (on any operating system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-10-01 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven’t introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problem beforehand, but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we ask for user
testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides developers we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release candidate, because the more people are testing the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in February hits the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing your documents with the prerelease is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pdflatex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lualatex&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xelatex&lt;/code&gt;. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-features-of-the-first-prerelease-for-2020-10-01&quot;&gt;Main features of the first prerelease for 2020-10-01&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been quite busy (did Corona help?) and so already this first
prerelease contains close to thirty smaller and larger fixes and
enhancements. A full list is given in a draft version of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ltnews32&lt;/code&gt;
which you should be able to read by running&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;texdoc ltnews32
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the command line (or by any other means available at your operating
system—somewhere there should be a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ltnews32.pdf&lt;/code&gt; that
you can open with a PDF reader). The draft version is also available from our website as
&lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/ltnews32.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('ae10a427f62847639c5aadcc05cea97b');&quot;&gt;LaTeX2e News Issue 32 draft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I only touch two of the most important topics, but many
others are worth exploring too, so please check that documentation out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;providing-xparse-as-part-of-the-format&quot;&gt;Providing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt; as part of the format&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous release we added the LaTeX3 programming layer to the
LaTeX format to improve the loading speed when packages using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt;
are used (such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontspec&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt;). In the upcoming release we
are now extending this support by integrating &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt; so that the extended
interface for defining document-level commands becomes available out of
the box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables users and most importantly package developers to
easily define LaTeX commands with multiple optional arguments or
other syntax features with ease.
For details, check out the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt; documentation, e.g., via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;texdoc
xparse&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improving-the-font-series-handling&quot;&gt;Improving the font series handling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous release we extended NFSS (the new font selection scheme)
to better support modern fonts that offer different font faces, e.g.,
condensed, semi-bold, etc., and make them work seamlessly with each
other. Experiences with the extended interface showed that for some
use cases adequate support was still missing or that in special setups
the algorithms sometimes selected a wrong font series value. These
cases have now been resolved and additional support commands have been
added. For example, with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\IfFontSeriesContextTF{〈context〉} {〈true code〉}{〈false code〉}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can now define commands that behave differently depending on the
current font series context. The 〈context〉 to check has to be specified
as either &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bf&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;md&lt;/code&gt;. The command then chooses the 〈true code〉
or the 〈false code〉 based on where it is used (e.g., inside
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\textbf&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\bfseries&lt;/code&gt;) or not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;outlook&quot;&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We issue the first prerelease now in the hope that you will help by
making sure that all the enhancements and fixes inside are safe and
without any undesired side effects, so please help with the testing if
you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We expect further extensions (currently under development) to be added
in a second prerelease, in particular a general hook management system
for LaTeX, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy — Frank&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Spring 2020 LaTeX release available</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-spring-2020-latex-release-is-available&quot;&gt;The spring 2020 LaTeX release is available&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we realized that the next LaTeX release was scheduled close to
a rather memorable day, we decided to delay the release by one day so
that it will now appear officially on February the 2nd 2020 (or on 20
20 02 02 if you use the ISO-date and arrange the spaces somewhat
unconventionally).  This release introduces a number of important
enhancements and so being able to use this date is a rather nice
opportunity to mark its importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;latex-now-contains-the-l3-programming-layer-as-part-of-its-format&quot;&gt;LaTeX now contains the L3 programming layer as part of its format&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in noticeable speed improvements for many documents
because these days they often (implicitly) load &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; at some point
in the preamble. This is the case for virtually all documents
processed with a Unicode engine, but also true for many pdfTeX
documents, because more and more packages use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt; or other
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt;-based code. Also important (and maybe more so) it will enable
us to successfully tackle large and difficult problems, such as
automatically producing tagged and accessible documents, in the near
future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-latex-font-selection-scheme-nfss-got-a-face-lift&quot;&gt;The LaTeX Font Selection Scheme (NFSS) got a face lift&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It now integrates some important enhancements that have been developed
in the recent years, including ideas from the packages &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontspec&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontaxes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mweights&lt;/code&gt;. Beside other improvements this will better
support the new font families that are made available for use with
LaTeX, because a large number of them provide additional font faces
(e.g., small caps italic, or a condensed series) and those could not
be supported in the old NFSS in a natural way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-to-learn-more-&quot;&gt;Where to learn more …&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new features and most the important bug fixes made in this release are documented in &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/ltnews31.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('ae10a427f62847639c5aadcc05cea97b');&quot;&gt;“LaTeX2e News Issue 31”&lt;/a&gt;. This document
can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/&quot;&gt;LaTeX2e news
page&lt;/a&gt; where you will also find
release information for earlier LaTeX releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topics-are&quot;&gt;Topics are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Experiences with the LaTeX&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; formats&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concerning this release … (LuaLaTeX engine)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved load-times for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvements to LaTeX font selection: NFSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other changes to the LaTeX kernel&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Changes to packages in the graphics category&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LaTeX requirements on engine primitives&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy LaTeXing

        <title>Issues 11 and 12 of LaTeX3 news released</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;issues-11-and-12-of-latex3-news-released&quot;&gt;Issues 11 and 12 of LaTeX3 news released&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been quite a gap since the last LaTeX3 News and there is a
lot to report.  By mistake LaTeX3 News 11 (nominally February 2018)
did not get published when written and we discovered this only when we
prepared issue 12.  We have kept the information it contains separate
as it is a good summary of &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex3-news/l3news11.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('2cf1bc0a478f4e45840d5a3de028200a');&quot;&gt;the work
that had happened in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaTeX3 News 12 then covers &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex3-news/l3news12.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('2cf1bc0a478f4e45840d5a3de028200a');&quot;&gt;the work done in 2018 and 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also added a document that &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex3-news/l3news.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('06009f5d88d4445cae1ba16872605b92');&quot;&gt;combines
all twelve LaTeX3 newletters in historical order&lt;/a&gt;. This gives some
interesting insights into the activities of the last decade and clearly
shows the increased activities of the team in the recent years, now
that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; (the programming layer of LaTeX3) gains more and more
followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will find all newletters as individual PDF files also on &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex3-news/&quot;&gt;the
LaTeX3 newletter page&lt;/a&gt; on this
site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—Enjoy

        <title>Second prerelease of LaTeX 2020-02-02 is available for testing</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-second-and-final-latex-prerelease-for-2020-02-02-is-available-for-testing&quot;&gt;The second (and final) LaTeX prerelease for 2020-02-02 is available for testing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days ago we submitted a new LaTeX development format to
CTAN and by now it should be available to all users using MikTeX or
TeX Live (on any operating system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-02-02 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven’t introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problem beforehand, but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we ask for user
testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides developers we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release candidate, because the more people who test the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in February hits the streets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing your documents with the prerelease is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pdflatex&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;lualatex&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xelatex&lt;/code&gt;. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;please-test-now--this-is-the-final-pre-release-prior-to-the-main-2020-02-02-release&quot;&gt;Please test now — this is the final pre-release prior to the main 2020-02-02 release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask you to test now, because this pre-release (with the execption
of some further documentation improvements) is representing the
2020-02-02 in the way we want to roll it out in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you encounter any issues with it, please open a bug report at our
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/issues&quot;&gt;Issue Tracker for LaTeX2e&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-features-of-2020-02-02-prerelease-3&quot;&gt;Main features of 2020-02-02 prerelease 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For technical reasons this second prerelease is labeled “prerelease 3”.
Prerelease 1 existed only for a few hours on CTAN, as it was missing
some files due to a problem in the build process, but because it was
already on CTAN we had to increase the prerelease number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improvements-for-selecting-and-managing-modern-fonts&quot;&gt;Improvements for selecting and managing modern fonts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many modern fonts available these days offer additional font faces,
e.g., small caps italics or a condensed font series, etc. To better
support these fonts NFSS (the New Font Selection Mechanism for
LaTeX) was extended by incorporating ideas from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mweights&lt;/code&gt;,
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontaxes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontspec&lt;/code&gt; packages.  In addition all symbols formerly
provided through the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;textcomp&lt;/code&gt; package are now available out of the
box and the use of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\oldstylenums&lt;/code&gt; got improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also fixed a number of smaller bugs. A detailed description of the
new features and the bug fixes can be found in a &lt;em&gt;draft&lt;/em&gt; version of
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ltnews31&lt;/code&gt; which you can access via &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;texdoc ltnews31&lt;/code&gt; if the
pre-release is installed on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-features-already-available-in-the-previous-pre-release&quot;&gt;Main features already available in the previous pre-release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a summary of the main features that were made available earlier in the first pre-release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-new-luatex-engine-coming-up-&quot;&gt;A new LuaTeX engine coming up …&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In TeXLive 2020 the LuaLaTeX format will always use the new LuaHBTeX
engine, which is LuaTeX with an embedded HarfBuzz library.
HarfBuzz can be used by setting a suitable renderer in the font
declaration. An interface for that is provided by the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontspec&lt;/code&gt; package.
This additional font renderer will greatly improve the shaping of
various scripts, which are currently handled correctly only by
XeTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify the testing of the new engine, the necessary executables
have been added to MiKTeX and TeXLive 2019 and both have changed the
LuaLaTeX-dev format to use it. &lt;em&gt;This means you can already now test
the new engine by using the prerelease!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you have no need for the new HarfBuzz functionality it might
be worthwhile running some tests, because, from 2020 onwards this will
be the only LuaTeX engine for which a LaTeX format will be distributed
in TeXLive and MikTeX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improved-load-times-for-expl3&quot;&gt;Improved load-times for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LaTeX3 programming layer, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt;, has over the past decade moved
from being largely experimental to broadly stable. It is now used in a
significant number of third-party packages, either explicitly or
implicitly (e.g., by loading &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt; to define user command
interfaces), so that many documents load the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; code at some
point in the preamble. Most LaTeX documents compiled using XeTeX or
LuaTeX load &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fontspec&lt;/code&gt;, which is written using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; so in these
engines it is nearly always used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; layer contains a non-trivial number of macros, and when
used with the XeTeX and LuaTeX engines, it loads a large body of
Unicode data.  This means that even on a fast computer, there is a
relatively large load time penalty whenever &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this release, the team have made adjustments in the LaTeX 2e kernel to
pre-load a significant portion of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; when the format is built. This is
transparent at the user level, other than the significant decrease in document
processing time: there will be no “pause” for loading Unicode data
files. Loading of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; in documents and packages can be done as usual;
it will, at some future time, become possible to omit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\RequirePackage{expl3}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;entirely, but, to support older formats, this explicit loading is at
present still recommended.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prereleases-will-never-go-stale-in-the-future-we-hope&quot;&gt;The prereleases will never go stale in the future (we hope)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The release policy we will follow should ensure that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt;
releases are never older than the main release.
When a full 2020-02-02 release is made, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; release will be
updated to be the same format, or possibly
a pre-release of the next release. It will not be left as a
pre-release of 2020-02-02 at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-details-on-prereleases-please-&quot;&gt;More details on prereleases please …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details and some background information about these concepts and
the process of the development formats is available in a TUGboat
article:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;How do you prevent creating banana software (i.e., software that
gets ripe at the customer site)? By proper testing! But this is
anything but easy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The paper will give an overview of the efforts made by the LaTeX
Project Team over the years to provide high-quality software and
explains the changes that we have made this summer to improve the
situation further.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First prerelease of LaTeX 2020-02-02 is available for testing</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-first-latex-prerelease-for-2020-02-02-is-available-for-testing&quot;&gt;The first LaTeX prerelease for 2020-02-02 is available for testing&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;main-features-of-2020-02-02-prerelease-2&quot;&gt;Main features of 2020-02-02 prerelease 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For technical reasons this first prerelease is labeled “prerelease 2”.
Prerelease 1 existed only for a few hours on CTAN, as it was missing

&lt;h3 id=&quot;please-test-now--even-though-there-is-more-to-come&quot;&gt;Please test now — even though there is more to come&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask you to test now, because (unless we made some mistakes) the
above changes should be transparent to the user — other than
speeding up the load process or allowing to handle complicated scripts
with LuaLaTeX that before would not work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably early January we expect to distribute another prerelease which
will most likely contain improvements to the font support for all engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-prereleases-will-never-go-stale-in-the-future-we-hope&quot;&gt;The prereleases will never go stale in the future (we hope)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with this prerelease we will make sure that the prerelease
in the distributions either matches the main release code or will be
newer than the current main release. This was not the case in the last
few weeks when the main release was 2019-10-01 with a few hot fixes
added, but the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-dev&lt;/code&gt; format was still from some day prior to October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future we intend to ensure that this does not happen, so that,
to avoid confusion, the distributed development release is always
newer or the same as the current main release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details and some background information about these concepts and
the process of the development formats is available in a TUGboat

        <title>New October 2019 LaTeX release available</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;october-2019-latex-release-available&quot;&gt;October 2019 LaTeX release available&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have recently released the October 2019 LaTeX distribution to CTAN from where it automatically moves (or has moved) to the major TeX distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This release fixes a small number of bugs and introduces some new features. The most important ones are documented in &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/ltnews30.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('7000e177ed02498cb64066adbedb6d81');&quot;&gt;“LaTeX2e News Issue 30”&lt;/a&gt;. This document
can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/&quot;&gt;LaTeX2e news
page&lt;/a&gt; where you will also find
release information for earlier LaTeX releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topics-are&quot;&gt;Topics are:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LaTeX development formats now available&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving Unicode handling in pdfTeX&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving file name handling in pdfTeX&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improving the filecontents environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Making more user commands robust&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other changes to the LaTeX kernel, tools and amsmath&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Documentation updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy LaTeXing
— Frank&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Major news: LaTeX development formats are now available</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;latex-development-formats-are-now-available&quot;&gt;LaTeX development formats are now available&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that many of you, especially developers and maintainers
of important packages, have a strong interest in a stable LaTeX 
environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to keep LaTeX very stable for users whilst allowing for
further development to continue, we now have a development branch of
LaTeX on GitHub containing development code for the upcoming release.
When this code is ready for wider consumption and testing, we generate
a pre-release of LaTeX from this development branch and make it
available on CTAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For users of the TeXLive and MikTeX distributions it is therefore now
straightforward to test their documents and code against the upcoming
LaTeX release with ease, simply by selecting a different program name
(when using the command line) or by selecting a menu entry (after
setting it up, see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do this then the latest version of the LaTeX development 
format will be used to process your document, allowing you 
to test the upcoming release with your own documents and packages.
For example, if you run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pdflatex-dev myfile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then you will be greeted on the screen with
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LaTeX2e &amp;lt;2019-10-01&amp;gt; pre-release-2&lt;/code&gt; (identifying the pre-release
format) instead of the normal &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LaTeX2e &amp;lt;2018-12-01&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  In this
pre-release you will find the latest new features that we have
developed. Here is an example of upcoming features that are currently
only in the pre-release format: better UTF8-handling as described in
&lt;a href=&quot;/publications/indexbyyear/2019&quot;&gt;Taming UTF-8 in pdfTeX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, that these are not `nightly builds’ of the format reflecting the
very latest stage of development, but pre-release versions that we have
tested ourselves so that we consider them ready for testing by a 
broader community, prior to their public release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;our-hopes&quot;&gt;Our hopes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t expect everybody to start using the development formats to
participate in testing, but we hope that people with a strong interest
in a stable LaTeX environment (especially developers and maintainers
of important packages) will use the new facilities and help us to
ensure that future public releases of LaTeX do not (as has happened in
the past) require some immediate patches because of issues that were
not identified by our internal regression test suite or by other
testing that we do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any issue identified when using the development format should preferably
be logged as an issue on GitHub, following the procedure outlined in
&lt;a href=&quot;/bugs/&quot;&gt;www.latex-project.org/bugs/&lt;/a&gt;
including the use of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;latexbug&lt;/code&gt; package as described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our bug reporting process normally states that issues involving
third-party software are out of scope as we can’t correct external
packages.  However, in the particular case of the development 
format showing an
incompatibility with a third-party package, it is fine to open an issue
with us (in addition, please, to informing the maintainer of that package)
so that we know about the problem and can jointly work on resolving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;details-please-&quot;&gt;Details please …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details and some background information about the concepts and
the process is available in an upcoming TUGboat article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-latex-release-workflow-and-the-latex-dev-formats&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/publications/2019-FMi-TUB-tb125mitt-dev-format.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;vgwPixelCall('03770697eae2427c8a6bfe7e9b8ab332');&quot;&gt;The LaTeX release workflow and the LaTeX dev formats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-menu-items&quot;&gt;Setting up menu items&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the command line call works out of the box if you have a recent
uptodate TeXLive or MikTeX installation, the use within an integrated
editing environment doesn’t at this point in time (maybe the
developers of these editors will include it in the future). However,
it is normally fairly simple to enable it as most (or even all?) of
them provide simple ways to call your own setup. How this works in
detail depends very much on the environment you use, so we can’t give
much help here. But as an example: to provide an additional menu entry
for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;XeLaTeX-dev&lt;/code&gt; all I had to do was to copy the file
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;XeLaTeX.engine&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;XeLaTeX-dev.engine&lt;/code&gt; and change the call from
&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xelatex&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xelatex-dev&lt;/code&gt; inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy — Frank &amp;amp; Chris&lt;/p&gt;

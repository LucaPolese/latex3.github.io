        <title>New snapshot (SVN 6984) of LaTeX3 code released to CTAN</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;latex3-code-snapshot-svn-6984-released-to-ctan&quot;&gt;LaTeX3 code snapshot (SVN 6984) released to CTAN&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/about/team/#joseph-wright&quot;&gt;Joseph&lt;/a&gt; recently submitted the following updates of LaTeX3 material to CTAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;xparse-package&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Adjustments to xparse to allow document commands to continue
to function inside csnames: note that the team expect to give
a clear statement on the scope of use of document commands in
the near future&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\NewExpandableDocumentCommand&lt;/code&gt; and related commands have been
added to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xparse&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\IfValue(TF)&lt;/code&gt; is now marked as stable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There have been some questions about the (removed) k-type
argument: see &lt;a href=&quot;http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/357187&quot;&gt;StackExchange question&lt;/a&gt; for
some transitional code (note that the replacement e-type
&lt;em&gt;is experimental&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;xfp-package&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;xfp&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New package to provide a document level interface to the LaTeX3 FPU:
&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\fpeval&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;expl3-programming-interface&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;expl3&lt;/code&gt; programming interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;New &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\tl_range:nnn&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduction in use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;\c_&amp;lt;number&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; constants in favour of explicit
numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;l3build-system&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;l3build&lt;/code&gt; system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normalisation of lines from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;luaotfload&lt;/code&gt; added&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better performance of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cmdcheck&lt;/code&gt; target when working with
file bundles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, this may take a day or so to propagate.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New LaTeX release --- Issue 26 of LaTeX2e news released</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-latex-release-----issue-26-of-latex2e-news-released&quot;&gt;New LaTeX release — Issue 26 of LaTeX2e news released&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have made a new LaTeX distribution with improves the support for
the Unicode engines and has a number of other updates and
improvements. Also important: we now officially require the engines to
support the eTeX primitives in order to build a LaTeX format (all
major engines do that already for a long time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important changes and additions are documented in
ltnews26.pdf. It can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/&quot;&gt;LaTeX2e news
page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Videos from the memorial for Sebastian Rahtz (13.2.1955 - 15.3.2016)</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;videos-from-the-memorial-for-sebastian-rahtzhttpsenwikipediaorgwikisebastianrahtz-1321955---1532016&quot;&gt;Videos from the memorial for &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Rahtz&quot;&gt;Sebastian Rahtz&lt;/a&gt; (13.2.1955 - 15.3.2016)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year our good friend and colleague Sebastian Rahtz passed
away — with him the TeX community lost one of its very influencial
members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On September 27th 2016 the Oxford e-Research Centre hosted a memorial
session for Sebastian at Wolfram College, Oxford titled “SPQR a
digital legacy: what Sebastian Patrick Quintus Rahtz did for us”.
Videos of the event have now been made available and they are
certainly worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phil Taylor talks about &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/tex-and-latex-software&quot;&gt;Sebastian’s contributions to the TeX
world&lt;/a&gt; and Anne
Trefethen reads &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/tex-live-don-knuth-remembers-spqr&quot;&gt;a short statement from Don
Knuth&lt;/a&gt;. I
very much enjoyed listening to Joe Talbot’s talk about &lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/what-sebastian-taught-us&quot;&gt;“What
Sebastian Taught
Us”&lt;/a&gt; and there are
&lt;a href=&quot;http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/sebastian-rahtz-celebration-his-work&quot;&gt;many more presentations that are all worth
watching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a short memorial on Sebastian for the Technische Komödie (the
newsletter of the German TeX User’s Group (DANTE)). It was also was
also translated to English as a TUGBoat article. Both articles can be
found on the &lt;a href=&quot;/publications/&quot;&gt;Publications page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sebastian and his legacy will stay with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New procedure for reporting LaTeX bugs</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;new-procedure-for-reporting-latex-bugs&quot;&gt;New procedure for reporting LaTeX bugs&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LaTeX Project Team maintains
&lt;a href=&quot;/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?introduction=yes&amp;amp;state=open&quot;&gt;a
    bugs database&lt;/a&gt; for the core LaTeX software (LaTeX kernel +
packages maintained by the team).
Due to the fact that we get more and more bug reports that we can’t
help with (as they are for one of the many third-party packages out
there) we have written a small package that helps with classifying
issues and that identifies the correct addressee for a bug report.
This package should be used in every test file showing a bug prior to
reporting that bug to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new procedure and some helpful information is now described in a
dedicated &lt;a href=&quot;/bugs&quot;&gt;bugs page that you find here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;tenth-issue-of-latex3-news-released&quot;&gt;Tenth issue of LaTeX3 news released&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since we published an issue on LaTeX3 development topics,
but that doesn’t mean nothing has happened in the meantime. On the
contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue number ten of the &lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex3-news/&quot;&gt;LaTeX3
news&lt;/a&gt; brings some info about testing
LaTeX (or even non-LaTeX) packages using l3build; refinements to expl3; an experimental
extension to xparse and on globally optimized pagination of
documents.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Future releases of LaTeX will require an eTeX-enabled engine</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;future-releases-of-latex-will-require-an-etex-enabled-engine&quot;&gt;Future releases of LaTeX will require an eTeX-enabled engine&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaTeX2e was released in 1994 and since then the LaTeX3 Project have
been committed to keeping it working smoothly for users. That means
balancing up keeping the code stable with fixing bugs and adding new
features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2003 the team
&lt;a href=&quot;/news/latex2e-news/ltnews16.pdf&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://texdoc.net/texmf-dist/doc/etex/base/etex_man.pdf&quot;&gt;eTeX
extensions&lt;/a&gt;
would be used by the kernel when they were available. The new
primitives offered by eTeX make many parts of TeX programming easier
and often there’s no way in ‘classical’ TeX to get the same effect. As
eTeX was finalised in 1999, starting to use it seriously in around
2004 meant most people had access to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the availability and use of eTeX has spread, and almost
all users have them available. Indeed, the standard format-building
routines for LaTeX have included them for many years. There are also a
lot of packages on CTAN that use eTeX, most obviously any using the
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ctan.org/pkg/l3kernel&quot;&gt;expl3 programming language&lt;/a&gt; that the
LaTeX3 Project have created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team had always meant to say at some stage that eTeX was now
required, and indeed thought we had until we checked over the official
newsletters! So as of the next LaTeX2e release, scheduled for the
start of 2017, the kernel will only build if eTeX is enabled. For
this release, we are likely to add a test for eTeX but no actual use
directly in the kernel, though in the future there will probably be
more use of the extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>LuaTeX 1.0 announced</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;luatex-10-announced&quot;&gt;LuaTeX 1.0 announced&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big congratulations from us to the LuaTeX Team for achieving this
hugely important milestone! It was very much awaited and we are
looking forward to seeing more code in the LaTeX world that makes use
of the extended possibilities offered by the LuaTeX engine now that it
has reached a stable state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congrats!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;here-is-the-original-announcement-from-the-luatex-team&quot;&gt;Here is the original announcement from the LuaTeX Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Version 1.0.0&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After some ten years of development and testing, today we have released
 LuaTeX 1.0.0! Instead of staying below one and ending up with versions
 like 0.99.1234, we decided that the moment is there to show the TeX
 audience that LuaTeX is stable enough to loose its beta status. Although
 functionality has evolved and sometimes been replaced, we have been using
 LuaTeX in production right from the start. Of course there are bugs
 and for sure we will fix them.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Our main objective is to provide a variant of TeX that permits user
 extensions without the need to adapt the inner workings. We did add a few
 things here and there but they mostly relate to opening up the inner parts
 and/or the wish to influence some hard coded behaviour. Via Lua we managed
 to support modern functionality without bloating the code or adding more
 and more dependencies on foreign code. In the process a stable and flexible
 MetaPost library became part of the engine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The functionality as present now will stay. We might open up some more
 parts, we will stepwise clean up the code base while staying as close as
 possible to the Knuthian original, we will try to document bits and pieces.
 We might also experiment a bit with better isolation of the backend, and
 simplify some internals. For that we might use the experimental version
 but if we divert too much we may need to give that another name.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;We want to thank all those who have tested the betas and helped to make
 LuaTeX better.&lt;/p&gt;

 Hartmut Henkel,
 Taco Hoekwater,
 Luigi Scarso&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>DocEng '16: A Framework for Globally Optimized Pagination</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-framework-for-globally-optimized-pagination&quot;&gt;A Framework for Globally Optimized Pagination&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At DocEng ‘16 the ACM Symposium on Document Engineering Frank
presented a paper on “A Framework for Globally Optimized Pagination”
that discusses an algorithm and its theoretical foundation for
globally optimized pagination using a dynamic programming
approach. The paper was awarded with the “ACM Best Paper Award” of the
conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full paper can be downloaded from the ACM Digital library through a link on the &lt;a href=&quot;/publications/&quot;&gt;Publications
page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;abstract-of-the-paper&quot;&gt;Abstract of the Paper&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pagination problems deal with questions around transforming a source
text stream into a formatted document by dividing it up into
individual columns and pages, including adding auxiliary elements that
have some relationship to the source stream data but may allow a
certain amount of variation in placement (such as figures or
footnotes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally the pagination problem has been approached by separating
it into one of micro-typography (e.g., breaking text into paragraphs,
also known as h&amp;amp;j) and one of macro-typography (e.g., taking a galley
of already formatted paragraphs and breaking them into columns and
pages) without much interaction between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While early solutions for both problem spaces used simple greedy
algorithms, Knuth and Plass introduced in the ’80s a global-fit
algorithm for line breaking that optimizes the breaks across the whole
paragraph [1]. This algorithm was implemented in TeX’82 [2] and has
since kept its crown as the best available solution for this
space. However, for macro-typography there has been no (successful)
attempt to provide globally optimized page layout: all systems to date
(including TeX) use greedy algorithms for pagination. Various problems
in this area have been researched (e.g., [3,4,5,6]) and the literature
documents some prototype development. But none of these prototypes
have been made widely available to the research community or ever made
it into a generally usable and publicly available system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a framework for a global-fit algorithm for page
breaking based on the ideas of Knuth/Plass. It is implemented in such
a way that it is directly usable without additional executables with
any modern TeX installation. It therefore can serve as a test bed for
future experiments and extensions in this space. At the same time a
cleaned-up version of the current prototype has the potential to
become a production tool for the huge number of TeX users world-wide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper also discusses two already implemented extensions that
increase the flexibility of the pagination process: the ability to
automatically consider existing flexibility in paragraph length (by
considering paragraph variations with different numbers of lines [7])
and the concept of running the columns on a double spread a line long
or short. It concludes with a discussion of the overall approach, its
inherent limitations and directions for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

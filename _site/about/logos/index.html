<p>We’ve put together some assets for those times when you want to show
off your work as being produced by LaTeX, or link back to us. Happy
typesetting!</p>

<p>We are happy to thank <a href="https://github.com/cereda">Paulo Cereda</a> for
designing and implementing the “hummingbird” logo for LaTeX.</p>

    <h2>Please avoid misrepresentation ...</h2>
    <ul>
   
      <li>Please avoid when naming or describing <em>your projects or
	  products</em> anything that implies endorsement by The LaTeX Team unless we have
	  explicitly authorized this</li>
    
      <li>In particular, please refrain from using the term "The LaTeX
          Team" or the LaTeX logos except when you are referring
          directly to us or to the software produced by us</li>

      <li>Other usages are likely to imply that
          your product is in some way directly or indirectly related
          to us</li>

      listed as undesirable, on this page</li>
    
      <li> you want to base your own logo on these images</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>In summary </h2>
    
    <p>In short, the LaTeX logos (with the hummingbird or the head of
       the hummingbird) represent only the work by "The LaTeX Team"
       and should not be used to represent <em>your products,
       organisation or services</em>.</p>

  </div>
</div>



<h2> LaTeX logos used within normal text</h2>

<p>In a document produced by LaTeX you can generate the textual form
of the LaTeX logo by simply using commands like
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\LaTeX{}</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\LaTeXe{}</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">\LaTeX3</code> for the different textual logos.</p>

<p>Please use the ASCII form of these logos which are
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX 2e</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LaTeX3</code>
in case the document is produced with software that
cannot correctly raise and lower characters.</p>

<p>Please do <em>not</em> use other forms of capitalizations,
e.g.,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">LATEX</code> or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">latex</code> would be incorrect!</p>

  <h1>Getting LaTeX</h1>
<p>LaTeX is <a href="http://www.debian.org/intro/free">free software</a> under the terms of the <a href="/latex-project.org/lppl/">LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL)</a>. LaTeX is distributed through <a href="#ctan">CTAN servers</a> or comes as part of many easily installable and usable <a href="http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free">TeX distributions provided by the TeX User Group (TUG)</a> or third parties. If you run into trouble, visit the <a href="/latex-project.org/help/">help section</a>.</p>
<hr>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col cell1of3">
    <h2><span class="fa fa-linux"></span> Linux</h2>
    <p>Check your distributions software source for a TeX system including LaTeX; it is probably included. If not, install <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive">TeX Live</a> directly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col cell1of3">
    <h2><span class="fa fa-apple"></span> Mac OS X</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> distribution contains everything you need, including a complete TeX system with LaTeX itself and editors to write your documents.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col cell1of3">
    <h2><span class="fa fa-windows"></span> Windows</h2>
    <p>Check out the <a href="http://www.tug.org/protext/">proTeXt</a> system; this allows you to install a full TeX system, including LaTeX, while reading about the basics of the installation.</p>
  </div>
  <hr>
</div>

<h3 id="distributions">TeX Distributions</h3>
<p>If you're new to TeX and LaTeX or just want an easy installation, get a full TeX distribution. The TeX Users Group (TUG) has a <a href="http://www.tug.org/interest.html#free">list of notable distributions</a> that are entirely, or least primarily, free software.</p> 
<div class="row">
  <div class="col cell1of2">
    <p>LaTeX is not a stand-alone typesetting program in itself, but document preparation software that runs on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald E. Knuth</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX">TeX typesetting system</a>. TeX distributions usually bundle together all the parts needed for a working TeX system and they generally add to this both configuration and maintenance utilities. Nowadays LaTeX, and many of the packages built on it, form an important component of any major TeX distribution.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col cell1of2">
    <p>The LaTeX team cannot guarantee that TeX distributions, even recent ones, contain the most recent version of LaTeX. It may happen that you need a more recent LaTeX than the one that your favourite TeX distribution carries, e.g., in order to get a particular bug fix. In that case you will need to fetch LaTeX from CTAN and install it on top of your distribution. See below for details.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="ctan">CTAN</h3>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col cell1of2">
    <p>You can obtain LaTeX by anonymous FTP from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN), which is the primary source of distribution for LaTeX. It provides copies of the LaTeX system on servers in several countries:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col cell1of2">
    <ul class="lsn">
      <li><span class="fa fa-download"></span> <a href="ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/">Download LaTeX from the US</a></li>
      <li><span class="fa fa-download"></span> <a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/">Download LaTeX from the UK</a></li>
      <li><span class="fa fa-download"></span> <a href="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/">Download LaTeX from Germany</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In order for your downloaded LaTeX to be of any use, you have to obtain and set up a TeX system first. You can either install a TeX distribution as described above or get a TeX system by FTP from the same CTAN servers. If you use a TeX distibution then it will include a version of LaTeX so this will probably make things easier for you; but you may have a reason not to do this.</p>
<hr>

<h2>LaTeX Subversion Repository</h2>
<p>The LaTeX sources are kept in a subversion repository. Anyone can access it and download them, but submission is restricted to team members. The Subversion repository is located at <a href="https://latex-project.org/svnroot/latex2e-public/">https://latex-project.org/svnroot/latex2e-public/</a>. You may check out a working copy of the code with the Subversion front-end of your choice or the command line statements:</p>
<pre>
  <code>mkdir latex2e-svn<br>svn co https://latex-project.org/svnroot/latex2e-public/ latex2e-svn</code>
</pre>
<hr>
<h3>Historic LaTeX</h3>
<p>Ulrik Vieth has collected historic versions of LaTeX from LaTeX 2.0 for TeX 1.0 (released on 11 December 1983) onwards. You can find them at <a href="ftp://ftp.tug.org/historic/macros/latex-saildart/">ftp://ftp.tug.org/historic/macros/latex-saildart/</a>. There might even be some earlier versions. All files have been pulled from the SAILDART archive site at <code>http://z.baumgart.org/saildart/prog/SYS/index.html</code> which is based on archive tapes from SAIL at Stanford.</p>
<p>More historic material can be found at <a href="ftp://ftp.tug.org/historic">ftp://ftp.tug.org/historic</a>.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This privacy statement explains to users the nature, extent and purpose, the collection and use of personal data by the responsible provider (The LaTeX Project, see contact page) on this website (referred to as “the offer” below).</p>

<h3 id="access-data--server-logs">Access data / Server logs</h3>

<p>The provider (or his internet provider) collects access data on each access to the offer (so-called server log files).</p>

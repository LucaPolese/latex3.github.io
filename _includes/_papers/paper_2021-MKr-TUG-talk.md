+ Abstract
> For a long time, Type 3 fonts in LaTeX-generated PDF files were known for (undesirable) bitmap fonts, but that’s only a small aspect of what this font format can do. With OpenType color fonts, the idea behind Type 3 fonts has seen a revival, and LuaTeX recently added support for adding such fonts for non-bitmap use cases too.
>
> In this talk I want to look at how this format can be used to create smaller and simpler PDF files involving color fonts and user-generated glyphs and consider advantages and disadvantages in contrast to traditional alternatives like virtual fonts or macrobased solutions.

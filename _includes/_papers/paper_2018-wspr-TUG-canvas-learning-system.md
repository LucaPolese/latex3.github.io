+ Abstract:

> In this presentation I will outline the system by which I produce PDF
> and HTML versions of course material for the honours project students in
> the School of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Adelaide.
> 
> This course material is broad and relatively dynamic in that it needs
> both frequent and periodic updates, and there is a soft need to have it
> available in a single document PDF and a hyperlinked HTML version. There
> are a number of tools to perform such a task, and LaTeXML was chosen for
> its robustness and relative simplicity. Nonetheless, the processing
> phase does involve some regexps to clean up the resulting HTML, which is
> not ideal from a maintenance perspective.
> 
> On the back end, this project could not have been accomplished without
> the API provided by the Learning Management System that we use, Canvas
> by Instructure. The web API allows HTML pages to be updated from the
> command line as well as PDF files to be automatically uploaded.
> 
> This system allows me to have a single source for the documentation for
> the course and makes updates almost entirely friction-free. While still
> cobbled together from a number of technologies (largely `curl` and shell
> scripts), it provides an interface that could be expanded for more
> general use.
> 
> In the future, as well as re-writing the code in Lua for cross-platform
> functionality, I also plan to overcome the problems involving use of
> embedded graphics with text, and mathematical content in general.

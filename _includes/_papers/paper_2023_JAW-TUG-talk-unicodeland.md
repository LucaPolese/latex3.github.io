+ Abstract
> 
> Getting text processing right for Unicode in TeX is a challenge, particularly where one wants to support the full range in pdfTeX. Over the past few years, I have worked on one aspect: case changing. Code to carry out the Unicode case changing algorithm was integrated into the LaTeX kernel a couple of years ago. Since then, we have been refining the details, adding more power and discovering new issues. Here, I’ll look at what we’ve done to get the code working smoothly, and look forward to what might still be improved.

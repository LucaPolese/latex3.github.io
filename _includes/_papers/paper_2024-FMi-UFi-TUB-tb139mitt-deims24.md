+ Abstract
> At the TUG 2020 online conference the LaTeX Project Team announced the start of a multi-year project to enhance LaTeX so that it will fully and naturally support the creation of structured document formats, in particular the “tagged PDF” format as required by accessibility standards such as PDF/UA.
>
> In this talk we present the current achievements of this project and the issues we encountered along the way. We also outline open areas of research and the future steps that we shall take to automatically produce well-tagged PDF that supports accessible standards (in particular, the recently finalized PDF/UA-2) as well as general reuse and further conversions. This will be achieved by embedding in the PDF a comprehensive description of the document structure.


The paper was originally presented at the DEIMS 2024 conference in Tokyo. A [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHbLa5fd2hI&t=10s), including a semi-live demonstration, is available on YouTube.

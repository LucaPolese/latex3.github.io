+ [TUG Conference 2018](http://tug.org/tug2018/) (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
+ Abstract:

>   In this talk I will re-examine my poor attempts at Literate
>   Programming and how they have shaped (for the better or worse)
>   the LaTeX world in the past decades.
>   It's about time to rethink some of the concepts invented back
>   then---but can we still evolve?

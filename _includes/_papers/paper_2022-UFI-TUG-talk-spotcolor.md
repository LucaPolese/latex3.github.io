> In this talk I recount some practical experiences with spot colors I gained while working on the third edition of _The LaTeX Companion_.    I describe what spot colors are, how to use them for text and (Ti_k_Z) graphics, how to mix them properly, and some of the pitfalls we found and how we worked around them.

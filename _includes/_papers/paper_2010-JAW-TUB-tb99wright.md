+ Abstract:
> The xparse package provides a new method for creating document macros,
> moving beyond \newcommand. With xparse it is possible for ordinary
> LaTeX users to create functions with multiple optional arguments,
> stars and mixtures of these. This brief article highlights using the
> xparse approach for the LaTeX user (as distinct from the LaTeX
> programmer).

A discussion by [Joseph Wright]({{site.baseurl}}/about/team/#joseph-wright) of some of
the new possibilities offered by the xparse package compared to those offered by \newcommand.

+ Abstract:

> While the fundamentals of both the `fontspec` and
> `unicode-math` packages
> have stayed the same, these packages have undergone a significant
> amount of development behind the scenes. While many users won't
> be interested in the technical details, there are a number of feature
> additions that deserve broader discussion.
> 
> In this presentation I will cover the basics of these packages and best
> practices for using them, specifically including more recent features
> that users may not yet have seen. I will also try to give an overview of
> some technical details to focus on `expl3` package development and
> lessons learned.

This paper presents an algorithm for globally optimized pagination
using dynamic programming and discusses its theoretical background. It was
awarded the "ACM Best Paper Award" at the DocEng 2016 conference. The
paper is the basis for the work demonstrated at BachoTek and
TUG 2016 (the order is reversed as submission deadline for DocEng was
already in March but the conference was in September).

A greatly extended version of this paper (37 pages) titled ["A General

was submitted to the Computational Intelligence Journal (Wiley) in
2017 and accepted January 2018.

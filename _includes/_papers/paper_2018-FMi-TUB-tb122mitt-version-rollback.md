+ Abstract:
> In 2015 a rollback concept for the LaTeX kernel was
> introduced. Providing this feature allowed us to make corrections to
> the software (which more or less didn’t happen for nearly two decades)
> while continuing to maintain backward compatibility to the highest
> degree.
>
> In this paper we explain how we have now extended this concept to
> the world of packages and classes which was not covered initially. As
> the classes and the extension packages have different requirements
> compared to the kernel, the approach is different (and
> simplified). This should make it easy for package developers to apply
> it to their packages and authors to use when necessary.


An article discussing the new rollback concept for packages and
classes. Together with the `latexrelease` package this forms a
comprehensive release management and compatibility solution for the
LaTeX universe.

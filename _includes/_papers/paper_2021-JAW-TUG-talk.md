+ Abstract
> TeX itself has no built-in support for colour, which is therefore handled by specials or engine-specific extensions. For LaTeX 2Îµ , the different interfaces are abstracted out by the color package. However, there is a lot that the color package does not do; for example, handling colour model interconversion, mixing colours or device-specific colour spaces. Packages such as xcolor and colorspace fill that gap, whilst the luacolor package addresses a separate issue: avoiding the need to use whatsits for colour at all.
>
> As part of wider efforts to enhance the LaTeX kernel via expl3 additions, recent work on the l3color package has brought many of these concepts into a single set of interfaces. That means not only copying existing ideas but also ensuring maximal functionality. In my talk, I will explore the work on l3color, highlighting where it can go beyond the predecessor packages in ease of use and functionality.

+ Abstract
> In this paper I recount some practical experiences with spot colors we gained while working on the third edition of The LaTeX Companion. I describe what spot colors are, how to use them for text and (TikZ) graphics, how to mix them properly, and some of the pitfalls we found and how we worked around them.

Continuing the quest for automatically finding optimal pagination of
documents the journey takes us now to the fairy land of
 objective functions,
 call-out constraints,

running YOU can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get
somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”
This talk explores how fast we must ran to enter that world.

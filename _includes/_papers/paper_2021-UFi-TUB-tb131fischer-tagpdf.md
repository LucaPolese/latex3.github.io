+ Abstract
> In this article I present two packages as part of the LaTeX Project’s “Tagged PDF” effort:
>  - *tagpdf* which contains the core code to create a tagged PDF and is used by the LaTeX team to test new code.
>  - *pdfmanagement-testphase* which contains a large number of PDF-related commands and tools and installs a new management command for central PDF dictionaries.
>
> I will show how to use these packages and the benefits they will bring for the average user, while also mentioning resulting incompatibilities and required changes in documents.

There is also a video from the
[talk given at the TUG online conference 2021 at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0ivQywNkAQ) on this topic.

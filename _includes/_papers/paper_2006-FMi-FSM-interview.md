+ Abstract
> [Free Software Magazine (FSM)](http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/)
> and the [TeX Users Group (TUG)](https://www.tug.org/) both like to publish
> interviews. Recently, Gianluca Pignalberi of Free Software Magazine
> and Dave Walden of TUG both approached Frank Mittelbach about
> interviewing him. Rather than doing two separate interviews,
> Mittelbach, Pignalberi, and Walden decided on a combined interview in
> keeping with the mutual interests already shared by Free Software
> Magazine and TUG.

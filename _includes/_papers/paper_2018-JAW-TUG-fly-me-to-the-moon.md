+ Abstract:

> Testing has been important to the LaTeX team since its inception, and
> over the years a sophisticated set of test files have been created for
> the kernel.  Methods for running the tests have varied over the past
> quarter-century, following changes in the way the team work.
> 
> In recent years, the availability of Lua as a scripting language in all
> TeX systems has meant it has become the natural choice to support this
> work. With this as a driver, the team have developed `l3build` for
> running tests automatically. Building on the core work, `l3build`
> has grown to provide a powerful approach to releasing packages (and the
> LaTeX kernel) reliably.
> 
> Here, I'll look at the background of our testing approach, before showing
> how and why Lua works for ushere.

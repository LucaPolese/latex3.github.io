+ Abstract
> On the afternoon before the formal conference program, the LaTeX project held a workshop, led by Ulrike Fischer, on generating tagged PDF from LaTeX. The workshop was well attended with more than thirty people participating â€” a good mix of package developers and end users. We thank DANTE e.V. for very generous financial support.
>
> The workshop was split into three parts. Firstly, a general introduction to tagging in PDF. Secondly, a demonstration of the process that a class or package maintainer should take to modify the code to produce well-tagged PDF. The acmart class was used for the example as its author, Boris Veytsman, was attending the workshop. Finally, we had a more open discussion on issues and desired syntax for structured tables.

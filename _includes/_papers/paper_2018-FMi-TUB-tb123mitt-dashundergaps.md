+ Abstract
> The dashundergaps package offers the possibility to replace material
> in running text with white space in order to build up forms that can
> be filled in at a later time.
>
> By default the gaps are underlined and followed by a gap number in
> parentheses, but many other designs are possible, e.g., dashes or
> dots instead of the underline, no gap numbers or a different format
> for them, gap widening for easier fill-in, etc.  There is also a
> teacherâ€™s mode which shows the normally hidden text in a special
> (customizable) format.
>
> This is another article in a series of TUGboat articles describing
> small packages to introduce coding practices using the expl3
> programming language. See <a

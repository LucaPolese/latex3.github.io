+ Keywords: LaTeX, tagging, paragraph  handling
+ Abstract
> In this talk I demonstrate and describe our solution for automatically tagging paragraphs when using engines such as pdfTeX or XeTeX. The situation with LuaTeX is different, and simpler, and therefore not the subject of this talk. I briefly touch on the problems one encounters and explain the approaches we used to overcome them. This will be done with a number of demonstrations intermixed with theoretical explanations.
>
>This work is part of our multi-year journey to gradually modernize LaTeX so that it can automatically produce high-quality tagged and “accessible” PDF without the need to post-process the result of the LaTeX run.

Video to be added when available.

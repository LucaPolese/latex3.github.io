+ Abstract
>The second edition of The LaTeX Manual begins: `LaTeX is a system for
>typesetting documents. Its first widely available version,
>mysteriously numbered 2.09, appeared in 1985.'
>
>It is too early for a complete critical assessment of the impact of
>LaTeX 2.09 because its world-wide effects on many aspects of many
>cultures, not least scientific publication, remain strong after 15
>yearsâ€”and that itself is significant in a technological world where a
>mere 15 months of fame can make and break an idea.
>
>Therefore this paper provides simply a review and evaluation of the
>relationship between TeX, LaTeX and some of the major technical
>developments in the world of quality automated formatting since the
>publication of LaTeX 2.09 in 1985. It is is neither definitive nor
>comprehensive but I hope it is informative.

+ Abstract
> 
> As the title indicates, this is part of the story of LaTeX in pictures, as seen from my eyes. It shows many highlights throughout the years and puts faces to names—some of which are in the audience but many not. It is based on what was available in my photo archive and certainly biased, but I nevertheless hope it is of some interest.

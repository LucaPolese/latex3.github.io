+ Abstract
> 
>In 2015, I talked about my work exploring Unicode-land, particularly how to carry out case changing in XeTeX and LuaTeX properly. Since then, `expl3` has become a part of the LaTeX kernel, and LaTeX has adopted UTF-8 as the standard input encoding.  The time has therefore become ripe to “open up” Unicode-land to allow MakeUppercase and MakeLowercase to roam free.  In this talk, I’ll remind us of what Unicode tells us about case changing, where the challenges are and how we’ve approached them in `expl3`. I’ll then show how this has combined with some *TeX features to enable us to make the switch, incorporate ideas from the textcase package and upgrade MakeUppercase and MakeLowercase for the 21st century.

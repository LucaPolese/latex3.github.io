+ Abstract
> During the last three years, LaTeX has spread widely, even into such
> new fields as business applications. The fact that there are new
> classes of users forces one to reconsider the LaTeX implementation and
> some of its features. Within a few years, LaTeX 2.09 alone will not be
> sufficient to satisfy the increasing needs of its users. As a
> consequence one of the important characteristics of the LaTeX concept
>  -- the possibility of exchanging documents -- is in danger of being
> sacrificed on the altar of local changes and enhancements.
> 
> Starting from these considerations and from our experiences of several
> years of LaTeX support, we will present a proposal for a
> re-implementation of LaTeX. This new version would not only preserve the
> essential features of the present user interface (in order to be
> compatible with old LaTeX files), but also take into account already
> formulated requests, as well as future developments.

> To understand the concepts in pdflatex for processing UTF-8 encoded
> files it is helpful to first take a look at the models used by the
> TeX engine and earlier attempts made by LaTeX on top of TeX. The
> talk provides a short historical review of that area and gives an
> overview about the improvements with respect to UTF-8 handling that
> will be activated in LaTeX within 2019.

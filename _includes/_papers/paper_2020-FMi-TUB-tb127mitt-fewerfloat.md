+ Abstract
> LaTeX’s ﬂoat algorithm has the tendency to produce fairly empty ﬂoat
> pages, i.e., pages containing only ﬂoats but with a lot of free space
> remaining that could easily be filled with nearby text. There are good
> reasons for this behavior; nevertheless, the results look unappealing
> and in many cases documents are unnecessarily enlarged.
> 
> The `fewerfloatpages` package provides an extended algorithm that
> improves on this behavior without the need for manual intervention by
> the user.

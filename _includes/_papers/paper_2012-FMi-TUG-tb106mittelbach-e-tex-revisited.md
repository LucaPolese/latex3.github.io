In 1990 shortly after Don Knuth announced TeX 3.0 Frank gave a paper
analyzing TeX's abilities as a typesetting engine.  This paper now
revisits the findings from more than two decades ago to see what has
been achieved since then, and perhaps more importantly, what can be
achieved now with computer power having multiplied by a huge factor
and last not least by the arrival of a number of successors to TeX
which have lifted some of the limitations identified back then.

> that will extend  LaTeX to produce tagged, and hence accessible, 
> PDF with minimal manual intervention.
>   It explains in detail both the
> project goals and the tasks that need to be undertaken, concluding
> with a detailed project plan.  It is our blueprint for for how we
> think the project should be undertaken.

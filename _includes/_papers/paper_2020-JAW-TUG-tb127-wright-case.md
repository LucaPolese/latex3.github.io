+ Abstract
> The concept of letter case is well established for several
> alphabet-based scripts, most notably Latin, Greek and Cyrillic. Upper-
> and lowercase are so widely used that it may not be obvious that there
> are several subtleties in converting case. However, those subtleties
> are important in supporting a wide range of users, and getting all of
> them right is non-trivial.
> 
> Whilst the English alphabet has simple casechanging rules, when we
> look beyond English and (possibly) beyond the Latin alphabet, tracking
> the requirements becomes more complicated. Many of these have been
> codified by the Unicode Consortium, and following these guidelines
> means that different pieces of software can give consistent outcomes.
> 
> Here, I want to look at how case changing can be set up in TeX,
> primarily focussing on tools that the LaTeX Project have provided,
> but in the wider context of the TeX ecosystem.

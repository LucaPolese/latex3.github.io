>LaTeX2Îµ introduced class and package setting in the optional arguments to `\documentclass` and `\usepackage`.
To date, these were designed to handle simple keyword-based option.
Over time, packages have extended the mechanism to accept key-value (keyval) arguments.
Recent work by the team brings keyval handling into the kernel.
This brings the added benefit of allowing repeated package loading to avoid clashes.
Here, I will look briefly at the background, then explore how to use the new mechanism in package development.

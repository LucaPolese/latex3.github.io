+ Abstract
> 
> With the summer 2023 release of the LaTeX format it is now possible to create tagged PDF in an automated way from many “Lamport documents”: documents using the commands described in the LaTeX manual from Leslie Lamport.
>
> In this talk I will show what is possible and what still needs manual intervention. I will also describe some of the challenges we faced on the technical side and when designing the mapping between LaTeX structures and the set of PDF tags.

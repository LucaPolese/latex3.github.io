+ Abstract:

> Over the past decade, `siunitx` has become established as the 
> major package for typesetting physical quantities in LaTeX. Here, I 
> will look at the background to the package, and how it's developed over 
> the years. I'll also lay out plans for the future: where are we going 
> for version 3, and why is that important for users.

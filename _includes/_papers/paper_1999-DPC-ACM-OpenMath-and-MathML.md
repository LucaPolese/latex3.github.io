Unambiguous representation of mathematics is crucial for
communications among humans or among computer systems. OpenMath is a
standard aimed at supporting a semantically rich interchange of
mathematics among varied computational software tools such as computer
algebra systems, theorem provers, and tools for visualizing or editing
mathematical text. MathML is a W3C Recommendation for the encoding of
mathematics 'on the web' which also includes mechanisms for encoding
mathematical semantics. We introduce each of these two languages and
describe their relationships.

This article discusses the typographical problem of widows and
orphans, i.e., first and last lines of a paragraph that due to a page
break are separated from the rest of the paragraph.

Practical advice is given how to best avoid these situations and how
to mangage and resolve them when they arise.  The final part discusses
the package `widows-and-orphans` that will help here by automatically
identifying and highlighting the problematical place in a longer
document, in fact not just for widows and orphans but also for words
hyphenated across a page break or math displays that got separated
from their preceding paragraph.

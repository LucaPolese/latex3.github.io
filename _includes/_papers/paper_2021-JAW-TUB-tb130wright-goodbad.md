+ Abstract
> Creating document commands in LaTeX has traditionally involved a mix of `\newcommand`, semi-internal kernel commands (like `\@ifnextchar` and `\@ifstar`) and low-level TeX programming using `\def`. As part of wider efforts to improve LaTeX, the team have over the past few years developed ideas for creating document commands in the package xparse. In a parallel article (on `\NewDocumentCommand`, on the following pages), Iâ€™ve looked at how the xparse ideas compare to the abilities of other packages.

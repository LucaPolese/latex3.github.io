+ Abstract:

> The expl3 language has grown over the past decade to cover a wide
>  range of programming tasks. However, at present there are a
>  number of areas where expl3 offers little or no 'core' support and
>  which will need functionality at this level. Here, Iâ€™ll be focussing
>  on one in particular: color and graphics support.

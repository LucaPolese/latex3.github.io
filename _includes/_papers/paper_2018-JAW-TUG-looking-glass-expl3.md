+ Abstract:

> The LaTeX3 programming language, `expl3`, has grown over the past
> decade to form a strong and stable environment for solving problems in
> TeX. A key aim is to grow this work to cover a wider range of areas. In
> recent work, the team have been building on the existing code, and in
> particular the expandable FPU, to develop approaches to color,
> drawing and image support.  In this talk, I will look at why this work
> is useful, what models we can work from and where the work has taken us
> so far.

+ Abstract
> This is a brief write-up of a talk given by the author at the TUG’20 online conference.
>

> The talk touches brieﬂy on the questions “where we are coming
> from” (we being the LaTeX Project Team), “where we are now” and
> then focusses on the LaTeX Project’s plans for the upcoming
> years, which will primarily be focussed on providing an out-of-the
> box solution for generating tagged PDF with LaTeX and will include
> gentle refactoring of parts of the core LaTeX and providing
> important functionality, such as extended standard support for
> color, hyperlinks etc., as part of the kernel.
>
> This is a multi-year journey that we have just started and we will
> brieﬂy explain the places this will take us through. At its end we
> expect that LaTeX users are able to produce tagged and
> “accessible” PDF without the need to post-process the result of
> their LaTeX run.

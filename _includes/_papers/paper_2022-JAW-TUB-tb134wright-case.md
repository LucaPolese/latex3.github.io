+ Abstract:
> The concept of letters having case is familiar to speakers of several languages, most obviously those from Europe using Latin, Greek or Cyrillic scripts. The ability to convert between upper and lower case, case changing, is something we might take for granted both for people and for computer systems. However, there are subtleties that a careful implementation needs to take into account...

This paper describes the new kernel mechanisms to manage this complexity.

A video on "[Case changing: LaTeX reaches Unicode-land (2022)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT6OKygUqRU)" as presented by Joseph at the TUG conference is also available.

> 
> The backend in TeX is responsible for the parts of producing output that TeX doesn’t know about, for example colour, image inclusion and hyperlink creation. Each backend has its own syntax and range of supported concepts, so at the macro level there needs to be the appropriate code to ‘talk’ to the backend. In expl3, we have developed a consistent set of backend support files, based on the experience of (La)TeX developers over 30+ years of working with these backends. Here, I will look at the history of backend abstraction and the model used in expl3.

+ [TUG Conference 2018](http://tug.org/tug2018/) (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil)
+ Abstract:

> In this talk I take a look at the major disruptions that have rocked the
> LaTeX world in the past decades and how we handled them, covering
> some of the resulting consequences.
> 
> In the latest part of this saga a rollback concept for the LaTeX
> kernel was introduced (around 2015).  Providing this feature allowed
> us to make corrections to the software (which more or less didn't
> happen for nearly two decades) while continuing to maintain backward
> compatibility to the highest degree.
> 
> I will give some explanation on how we have now extended this concept to
> the world of packages and classes which was not covered
> initially. As the classes and the extension packages have different
> requirements compared to the kernel, the approach is different (and
> simplified). This should make it easy for package developers to
> apply it to their packages and authors to use when necessary.

> The final conclusion is that this is an area where we can pose

> or XeTeX, unless you restrict the allowable input, as there is no
> way to obtain some of the information used by TeX’s algorithms for
> later manipulation of the result.

This article discusses certain aspects of TeX's approach to line
breaking and its consequences for automatically calculating the right
amount of vertical space between lines in more complex layouts.

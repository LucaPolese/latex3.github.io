> Since it was first released in 2008, `siunitx` has become established as the major package for typesetting physical quantities in LaTeX. Following up on my TUG 2018 talk, I will look at how the update to version 3 has gone now that this is out. Iâ€™ll briefly look at the background, then consider some of the user and developer efforts that have made the launch a success.

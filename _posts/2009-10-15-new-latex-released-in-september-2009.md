# New LaTeX released in September 2009

A new version of LaTeX was placed on CTAN a fortnight ago; it will be included in the upcoming TeX Live 2009. This version of LaTeX is a maintenance release only, but marks the first new version since the publication of The LaTeX Companion, 2nd Ed. In case you missed it earlier, the LaTeX source files are now [publicly available]({{site.baseurl}}/news/2009/01/25/latex2e-public-source-repository-announced/) and this is also the first release from this new location. More information can be found in [LaTeX News issue 19]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews19.pdf).

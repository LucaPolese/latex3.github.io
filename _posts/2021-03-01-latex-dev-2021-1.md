# The second LaTeX pre-release for 2021-05-01 is available for testing

A few days ago we submitted a new LaTeX development format to CTAN
and by now this should be available to all users using MiKTeX or TeX
Live (on any operating system).


## Main features of the second pre-release for 2021-05-01

The first pre-release was just a copy of the main release for
2020-10-01 in order to avoid that people using the development release
regularly get an old format.

The second pre-release now provides a number of smaller enhancements and
resolves roughly fourty issues. The more important ones are listed in
the draft publication of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews33.pdf">LaTeX2e News
Issue 33</a>. A full list is given in the `changes.txt` files that are
part of the distribution.




### Extending the general hook management system to paragraphs

In addition to the bug fixes and enhancements this second pre-release
also extends the general hook management system of LaTeX by supporting
paragraph hooks executed at the beginning and end of every paragraph.

This functionality is essential for the production of automatically
tagged PDF documents and resolves one of the major obstacles in this
area. It is thus an important step in our multi-year journey towards
accessible and well-tagged PDF documents, see articles in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications/indexbytopic/pdf/">PDF, Tagging, Accessibility</a>.

Even though this new functionality may not be of direct interest to
most users (as long as it is not yet used for processing accessible
PDF) it is nevertheless important that it gets tested to ensure that
there aren't any conflicts with existing packages that also try to
manipulate the paragraph processing in one way or the other. So please
make use of the development format whenever you have a chance, see
below for how to do this with ease.




## Outlook

We expect to produce a third and probably final pre-release adding
some more features and enhancement in early April.


## Please help with the testing

We are issuing this second pre-release now in the hope that you will help us by
making sure that all the enhancements and fixes we have provided are safe and that
they do not have any undesired side effects, so please help with the testing if
you can.

This development format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2021-05-01 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven't introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problems beforehand but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we are asking for user
testing.

Besides developers, we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release, because the more people that test the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in May hits the streets.

Processing your documents with the pre-release is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
`-dev` to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run

```
pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
```

instead of using `pdflatex`, `lualatex` or `xelatex`. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.

# Papers on "Float Placement" and "Regression Tests"

Two new articles have been uploaded: a paper describing in detail the mysteries of LaTeX's float placement algorithm (and how to influence it) and a paper presenting an overview about the new regression test concepts that can be used to manage LaTeX code. Both papers have been first published in TUGboat 35#3.

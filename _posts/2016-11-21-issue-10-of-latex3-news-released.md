# Tenth issue of LaTeX3 news released

It has been a while since we published an issue on LaTeX3 development topics,
but that doesn't mean nothing has happened in the meantime. On the
contrary.

Issue number ten of the [LaTeX3
news]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex3-news/) brings some info about testing
LaTeX (or even non-LaTeX) packages using l3build; refinements to expl3; an experimental
extension to xparse and on globally optimized pagination of
documents.

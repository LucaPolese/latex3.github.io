# The first online TUG conference will happen 24-26 July 2020

You probably heard this already from other sources and maybe already
registered, but if not, now is the time.

Next week the annual TeX Users Group Conference will be broadcasted
live and to watch the presentations and otherwise participate all you
need to do is to [register](https://tug.org/tug2020/). This year
registration is free of charge, because the costs for an online event
are much lower, so all that is needed to attend is the registration.

You will find many interesting and exciting talks in [the program
schedule](https://tug.org/tug2020/program.html) and while some my be
at inconvenient hours, depending on your location, most are probably
at reasonable times. If not there are plans to make the talks
available afterwards (no details yet), but live or partly live events
are usually more fun in my opinion.

A number of people from the LaTeX Project team are also presenting:
Javier,
Joseph,
Marcel and myself.

So go ahead and [register yourself](https://tug.org/tug2020/) if you are interested
and let us make this the biggest Tex conference in years!


Enjoy --- Frank

# LaTeX Graphics Companion 2ed is back in print

The LaTeX Graphics Companion 2nd edition, formerly publish by
Addision-Wesely in the "Tools and Techniques for Computer Typesetting"
series, went out of print a while ago. I'm happy to announce that this
has now changed again. Lehmanns Media has picked up the book and produced an
affordable reprint, both as printed softcover book and also as a PDF ebook
version:

 - [LaTeX Graphics Companion (softcover)](https://www.lehmanns.de/shop/mathematik-informatik/58611042-9783965433038-the-latex-graphics-companion), ISBN 978-3-96543-303-8 
 - [LaTeX Graphics Companion (ebook)](https://www.lehmanns.de/shop/mathematik-informatik/58574614-9783965432994-the-latex-graphics-companion), ISBN 978-3-96543-299-4

The book should be available from all major bookstores, the ebook version probably only from Lehmanns directly.

Happy LaTeXing

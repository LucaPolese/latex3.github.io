# Remembering [Sebastian Rahtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Rahtz) (13.2.1955 - 15.3.2016)

Earlier this year our good friend and colleague Sebastian Rahtz passed
away --- with him the TeX community lost one of its very influencial
members.
On September 27th 2016 the Oxford e-Research Centre will host a memorial
session for Sebastian at Wolfram College, Oxford titled ["SPQR a
digital legacy: what Sebastian Patrick Quintus Rahtz did for
us"](https://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/sebastian-rahtz). The event is open to anybody after registration.

Frank wrote a short memorial on Sebastian for the Technische Kom√∂die
(the newsletter of the German TeX User's Group (DANTE)). It was also was
also translated to English as a TUGBoat article. Both articles can be found on the [Publications
page]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/).

# New kids on the block

I'm happy to be able to announce that Ulrike Fischer and Enrico
Gregorio have joined the LaTeX Project Team (Enrico already early this
year, but I never properly announced that, so I'm doing that now). Contact
details are on [the team page]({{site.baseurl}}/about/team).

Ulrike is an accomplished and well-known LaTeX user, developer and TeX consultant,
known both for her work in various areas of TeX and her thoughtful user
support on various platforms both national and international.

Enrico is a professor at the Computer Science department of the
University of Verona. He will need no introduction either to any TeX
user who ever visited [TeX
StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com) where Enrico is known
under the name of `egreg`, the person who holds the highest
reputation rank there (a whooping 200k above the next person, who ---
guess what --- is also on the LaTeX Team).

We are extremely greateful to have both of them on board and gain from their
experience and knowledge!

A warm welcome ---
Frank

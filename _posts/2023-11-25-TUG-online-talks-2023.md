# Talks from the TUG Conference 2023 in Bonn

The TUG conference 2023 in Bonn was a hybrid conference, i.e., all talks were recorded and also streamed. The recordings have been cut and cleaned up by a few relentless volunteers and are now available on YouTube.
All in all, there are 30 interesting talks on various subjects TeX, LaTeX, and related topics.  If you have missed the conference (or if you want listen to one of the talks again) you will find them all on the [TeX Users Group Channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeXUsersGroup/featured).

There were also several talks by members of the LaTeX Project
team to which I like to draw your attention:

 - Ulrike Fischer: [Automated tagging of LaTeX documents—what is possible today?](https://youtu.be/3-owUEe23k8?feature=shared)
     — An overview the current status of the LaTeX Tagged PDF project.

 - Frank Mittelbach: [38 years with LaTeX—A personal picture story](https://youtu.be/L9NybNjtGDM?feature=shared)
      — A personal history in pictures of nearly four decades in the TeX world.
 - Frank Mittelbach: [The LaTeX Companion, 3rd edition—Anecdotes and lessons learned](https://youtu.be/QIxSXIwDiSo?feature=shared)
      —  A review of five years of work producing the new edition of the LaTeX Companion.

 - Joseph Wright: [Further adventures in Unicode-land: Refining case changing](https://youtu.be/UIK8FFZjFMU?feature=shared)
      —  A discussion of challenges in Unicode processing, in particular case changing.

 - Joseph Wright: [Supporting backends in expl3](https://youtu.be/m2ffkW3bckU?feature=shared)
     — A look at the history of backend abstraction and the model used in expl3 to provide a consistent experience across different TeX engines.

# Final pre-release of LaTeX for 2022-06-01ready for testing

Last week we submitted the final pre-release version for the 2022-06-01 LaTeX
kernel so it should be available in all major TeX distributions.

As always new functionality and bug fixes are discussed in the
corresponding <a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews35.pdf">LaTeX2e News
Issue 35</a> newsletter.

Because we are a few days behind our original schedule, we are going
to delay the main release for a few days too,  to give people
time to do some final testing. Please help with this testing!

Processing your documents with the pre-release is straightforward. All you have
to do is to replace the invocation command by appending -dev to the executable,
e.g., on the command line you would run

 - `pdflatex-dev myfile` or
 - `lualatex-dev myfile` or
 - `xelatex-dev myfile`

instead of using `pdflatex`, `lualatex` or `xelatex`. If you use an integrated
editing environment, then it depends on the system how to configure it to use an
alternative format; but in any case the necessary modification should be
straightforward.

# The first LaTeX prerelease for 2020-02-02 is available for testing

A few days ago we have submitted a new LaTeX development format to
CTAN and by now it should be available to all users using MikTeX or
TeX Live (on any operating system). For technical reasons this first
prerelease is labeled "prerelease 2" (prerelease 1 existed only for a
few hours on CTAN, as it was missing some files due to a problem in
the build process).

This format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-02-02 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven't introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problem beforehand, but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we ask for user
testing.

Beside developers we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release candidate, because the more people are testing the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in February hits the streets.

Processing your documents with the prerelease is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
`-dev` to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run

```
pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
```

instead of using `pdflatex`, `lualatex` or `xelatex`. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system how you
can execute an alternative binary, but in either case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.

## Main features of 2020-02-02 prerelease 2

### A new LuaTeX engine coming up ...

In TeXLive 2020 the LuaLaTeX format will always use the new LuaHBTeX
engine, which is LuaTeX with an embedded HarfBuzz library.
HarfBuzz can be used by setting a suitable renderer in the font
declaration. An interface for that is provided by the `fontspec` package.
This additional font renderer will greatly improve the shaping of
various scripts, which are currently handled correctly only by
XeTeX.

To simplify the testing of the new engine, binaries have been added to
MiKTeX and TeXLive 2019 and both have changed the LuaLaTeX-dev format
to use it. _This means you can already test the new engine by using the prerelease!_

Even if you have no need for the new HarfBuzz functionality, it might
be worth doing some testing, because going forward this will be the
only "Lua"TeX engine for which a LaTeX format will be distributed in
the future in TeXLive and MikTeX.



### Improved load-times for `expl3`

The LaTeX3 programming layer, `expl3`, has over the past decade moved
from being largely experimental to broadly stable. It is now used in a
significant number of third-party packages, most notably `xparse` for
defining user command interfaces, so that many documents load
the `expl3` code at some point in the preamble. Most LaTeX documents
compiled using XeTeX or LuaTeX load `fontspec`, which is written using
`expl3` so in these engines it is nearly always used.

The `expl3` layer contains a non-trivial number of macros, and when used
with the XeTeX and LuaTeX engines, it loads a large body of Unicode data.
This means that even on a fast computer, there is a relatively large load time for
using `expl3`.

For this release, the team have made adjustments in the LaTeX 2e kernel to
pre-load a significant portion of `expl3` as the format is built. This is
transparent at the user level, other than the significant decrease in document
processing time: there will be no "pause" for loading Unicode data
files. Loading of `expl3` in documents and packages can be done as usual;
eventually, it will be possible to omit
```
\RequirePackage{expl3}
```
entirely, but to support older formats, this is still recommended at present.

### Please test now --- even though there is more to come

We ask you to test now, because (unless we made some mistakes) the
above changes should be transparent to the user --- other than
speeding up the load process or allowing to handle complicated scripts
with LuaLaTeX that before would not work correctly.


Probably early January we expect to distribute another prerelease which
will most likely contain improvements to the font support for all engines.

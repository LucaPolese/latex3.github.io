# The LaTeX Companion, third edition is available for pre-ordering

I'm happy to announce that the third edition of [_The LaTeX Companion_](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=g/Y5ZYi0Q7I&mid=24808&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informit.com%2Fstore%2Flatex-companion-parts-i-ii-3rd-edition-9780138166489)
has been sent to the printers and is by now available for
pre-ordering. It will be published by end of April / beginning of May.
This is the end of five years of careful work and we hope that it will
provide our readers with all the information they need to successfully navigate the
LaTeX eco-system and efficiently produce beautiful documents.

Since the publication of the last edition (2004) a lot has happened in the
LaTeX world and thus  a complete rewrite was necessary.
All chapters have been thoroughly revised and in many cases largely
extended to describe new important functionality and features. More
than 5,000 add-on packages have been analyzed in detail, out of which
roughly 10% have been chosen for inclusion in [_The LaTeX Companion_](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=g/Y5ZYi0Q7I&mid=24808&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informit.com%2Fstore%2Flatex-companion-parts-i-ii-3rd-edition-9780138166489).
All important aspects of these packages are described
 to provide the user once again with
a satisfying one-stop--shop experience for the decade to come.


To cover what we thought worth describing today, the book nearly
doubled in size.
The print edition is therefore produced as a two-volume set and  sold as a bundle.
Both volumes come as hardcover with ribbons to easily mark pages in the book.

The edition is also available as an [eBook (Part I and II
combined)](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=g/Y5ZYi0Q7I&mid=24808&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informit.com%2Fstore%2Flatex-companion-parts-i-ii-3rd-edition-9780138115784)
consisting of PDF and ePub format without DRM.  Finally, the publisher
offers the combination of [the printed books + the digital versions](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=g/Y5ZYi0Q7I&mid=24808&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.informit.com%2Fstore%2Flatex-companion-parts-i-ii-3rd-edition-9780138166489)
at a very attractive price not available anywhere else.

# Talk from Symposium on Multilingual Information Processing, Tsukuba

Came across this on an old VHS tape that I couldn't process back then due to a lack of an NTSC capable TV. It is capturing the talk on "Language Information in Structured Documents: A Model for Mark-up and Rendering" given in 1997 in Tsukuba, Japan (so largely of historical interest). However, the content of [the paper]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/language-tug97-paper-revised.pdf) is still relevant to a large degree, as the outlined issues still exit today and for one or other reason the proposed solution has never been implemented up to now (except for a prototype in an early version of expl3). Given that expl3 is now stable it might be about time to revisit this.

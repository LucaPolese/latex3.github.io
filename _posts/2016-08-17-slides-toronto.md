# Globally optimized pagination with LaTeX

At the TUG 2016 conference in Toronoto Frank gave a presentation on
globally optimized paginiation using LuaTeX as the processing
engine.

The presentation demonstrated a framework for automatically producing
an optimal pagination for documents (containing floats) such as Alice
in Wonderland.

The slide deck (or rather the mindmap he used) and the demonstration
documents are now available on the [Publications
page]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/); the video of the talk will
follow in the near future.

# 3th issue of LaTeX3 news released

We have been working on two of the xpackages: xparse has been re-written and extended, and xtemplate is a new package with a new interface based on the older template package. For full details and plans for the next six months, see the [LaTeX3 news]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex3-news/) page.

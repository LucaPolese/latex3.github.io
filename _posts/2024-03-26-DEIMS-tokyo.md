# International [Digitization and E-Inclusion in Mathematics and Science 2024](https://workshop.sciaccess.net/deims2024/program.html) conference (DEIMS2024) in Tokyo

The conference was held as a hybrid conference, i.e., all talks were recorded and also streamed. Some of the talks were given remotely.
The [full playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHpRBFvRd88_EvTy4BKdrEPvdGdLf26wH&si=EZLSh9hUoSz39Kaa) with all talks is available at
YouTube.

Ulrike and I gave a talk on "[Enhancing LaTeX to automatically produce tagged and accessible PDF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHbLa5fd2hI&t=10s)" including a semi-live demonstration. The corresponding paper was also submitted to TUGboat and will appear there in the next issue.
You will find it in [the publication section]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/indexbytopic/pdf/) of this site.

The conference was very interesting and it was a very helpful experience to talk to people directly affected by accessibility issues.

Enjoy --- Frank

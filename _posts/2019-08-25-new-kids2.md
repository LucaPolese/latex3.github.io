# New kids on the block (2)

I'm happy to be able to announce that Phelype Oleinik and Marcel Krüger
have joined the LaTeX Project Team. Contact
details are on [the team page]({{site.baseurl}}/about/team).


Phelype is a Civil Engineer, a TeX enthusiast and an `expl3`
advocate---you'll find him on Stack Exchange answering complex
questions.  Marcel is an accomplished and well-known LuaTeX expert and
besides other activities is maintaining `luaotfload`.  With Marcel
joining we have formally adopted the work on `luaotfload` which is a
core component for making LaTeX available with a LuaTeX engine.  The
repository for this code is now
[https://github.com/latex3/luaotfload](https://github.com/latex3/luaotfload).


We are extremely greateful to have both of them on board and gain from their
experience and knowledge!


A warm welcome ---
Frank

# Publications now sorted by topic

In the past we collected publications by the project team members on a
single web page (with a few extra notes added to introduce the
publication). Over time that page got really more and more lengthly
and thus unusable.

Since we believe that a lot of the information there is actually quite
useful we have restructured this area to provide a view of all
publications **in chronological order** as well as **by major
topics**. Of course, chosing useful topics is hard and we may still
have to improve things here and there. For example, we know that we
should add further notes in some places.

But on the whole, this new view gives much better access to the
material available and brings a number of hidden gems (or so we think
:-) ) back into focus. So far each publication is sorted only under a
single topic. However, in some cases multiple topics might be more
approriate---we'll have to see.

Please try it out, the starting points are either

 - [Publications by Topic]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/indexbytopic)
 - or [Publications by Year]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/) which is
   in fact the main Publication page available from the menu.


If you have any comments or suggestions please feel free to [send me a
note]({{site.baseurl}}/about/team/#frank-mittelbach).

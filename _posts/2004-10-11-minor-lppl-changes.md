# Minor changes to LPPL

The [LaTeX project public license (LPPL)]({{site.baseurl}}/lppl/), [version 1.3a]({{site.baseurl}}/lppl/lppl-1-3a/), has been released. It includes a correction in the warranty section (the phrase «unless required by applicable law» got lost at some point) and clarification on the difference between «maintained» and «author-maintained».

### Japanese translations of some important documents

Yukitoshi FUJIMURA kindly translated two documents that are distributed with standard
LaTeX to the Japanese language. These are

 - LaTeX2e for authors
 - Userâ€™s Guide for the amsmath Package (Version 2.1)

You will find them [on the documentation page]({{site.baseurl}}/help/documentation/)
which got slightly reorganized at the same time. You will now also find there a compiled
version of the full LaTeX2e source code (with index etc) and a number of other goodies.

Enjoy --- Frank

# How to make accessible PDF

The "LaTeX Tagged PDF" project is now advanced enough that more and
more people start using it. We have therefore begun with building
usage documentation that is not scattered across different
repositories as this is the case at the moment.

For issues encountered with the project code we have added a dedicated
[`tagging-project`
repository](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project) a while ago,
where people can report problems and look up the current state of
known issues. It is also hosting discussions related to the project.

We have now extended this to use GitHub pages providing a small [Web
browser-friendly site](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/). So
far this holds

 - Examples of Tagged PDFs conforming to the WTPDf, PDF/UA-1, and PDF
 - A simple documentation what to do to produce accessible PDF
   (describing the current tempoary interfaces)
 - Tables the record the status of various packages and classes (i.e.,
   whether or not they can be used with the ned tagging code) based on
   the issues that are documented

This documentation and the tables are all work in progress and will
get updated whenever there is new information.


If you want to help improving this, then this is easily possible.  We
are looking for volunteers who try out the tagging code in various
ways and report problems or package incompatibilites and help with
developing tests that prove or disprove that the tagging code can be
used with packages for which we don't have enough data so far.

# Development releases for the L3 Programming Layer (aka `expl3`)

The team have made development releases of the LaTeX kernel available
for some time, to allow active users and developers to test new
features. We have now extended the concept to cover the core of
`expl3` (packages `l3kernel` and `l3backend`) that is automatically
loaded by the LaTeX kernel as the 'L3 Programming layer'.  The new
CTAN packages [`l3kernel-dev`](https://ctan.org/pkg/l3kernel-dev) and
[`l3backend-dev`](https://ctan.org/pkg/l3backend-dev) will be used
when building the development LaTeX formats, allowing testing of
changes to `expl3` before its release and thus before becoming active
in the production version of LaTeX.

We encourage interested users and especially developers to try out the
development formats, which will now include testing a pre-release
of the L3 Programming Layer `expl3`.

Unlike the LaTeX kernel, `expl3` does not have a fixed release
schedule.  To allow for that, the aim is that there will be an
`l3kernel-dev` upload to CTAN around two weeks before the upload of
the 'production' version.  This should be enough time for testing but
still allow a quick turn-around as features are added to `expl3`.

# Pre-release of LaTeX for 2022-06-01 ready for testing

We submitted the latest pre-release version for the 2022-06-01 LaTeX kernel
to CTAN recently. It should have made its way into TeX Live (both 2021 and the
2022 pre-test) for everyone by now, so it's ready for (somewhat) adventurous
users to try.

## New features in the kernel

### For users

One of the most significant changes in the code is one that users (hopefully)
won't notice: the definition of UTF-8 characters in pdfTeX. We have made these
engine-protected, which should make processing them in `expl3` a lot easier.
The way the change has been set up means we don't expect users to actually see
a difference, but we do want to hear about how it is working. So get your complicated
accents out and try them all over the place with pdfTeX. (LuaTeX and XeTeX
users won't even need to worry.) One thing that goes with this change is that
we have updated the definition of `\MakeUppercase` and `\MakeLowercase`, so
they use Unicode-aware `expl3` code 'behind the scenes'. Again, this should
be transparent to users, but it would be good to hear how it works in the wild.

More visible are a small set of new commands we are adding in this pre-release.
We are moving `\fpeval` and `\inteval` from the `xfp` package directly into
the kernel. We are also adding `ExpandArgs` and `UseName`, ideas again taken
from `expl3`. These commands allow control of expansion, so you can do a range
of basic expansion tasks in document commands, without needing TeX programming
or using `expl3`. For example, you can now do
```
\NewDocumentCommand\newcopyedit{mO{red}}
  {\newcounter{todo#1}%
   \ExpandArgs{c}\NewDocumentCommand{#1}{s m}%
     {\stepcounter{todo#1}%
      \IfBooleanTF {##1}%
         {\todo[color=#2!10]%
            {\UseName{thetodo#1}: ##2}}%
         {\todo[inline,color=#2!10]%
            {\UseName{thetodo#1}: ##2}}%
     }%
  }
```
which can create a document command by name: something people have been asking
for many years.

One more addition from `expl3` ideas is `\IfBlankTF`: this can test if it has
been given an entirely blank argument. Here, blank means empty or just spaces:
this comes up surprisingly often.

### For package authors

Package authors might well choose to use the features described above. There
is though one big change aimed squarely at packages: keyval-based option
handling. We have introduced a new set of commands, `\DeclareKeys`,
`\ProcessKeyOptions` and `\SetKeys`, which can be used to create keyvals and
to use them as package options. `\DeclareKeys` uses the same approach as the
`expl3` function `\keys_define:nn` to create keys: each key has one or more
'properties' which control how it behaves. We have provided a small number
of common properties at this stage, for storing key values in a macro, for
setting a switch and for executing some code. We have also provided a method
to define the usage of keys: whether they are only available at package
loading time, in the preamble or can also be used in the document body.
```
\DeclareKeys
  {
    draft.if    = @mypkg@draft      ,
    draft.usage = preamble          ,
    name.store  = \@mypkg@name      ,
    name.usage  = load              ,
    command.code = \showtokens{#1}
```

Package options can then be processed using `\ProcessKeyOptions`, which will
set keys defined by `\DeclareKeys`. Keys can also be set in the document
body using `\SetKeys`. All of these new commands take an optional argument to
define the key _family_: the namespace for the keys. This is by default the name
of the current package file.

More advanced key types can be created directly using `expl3` (`l3keys`): the
keys created by `\DefineKeys` are standard `expl3` keys.

Unlike traditional package options, loading a package using `\ProcessKeyOptions`
multiple times with different options will not lead to a clash error. Instead,
the options will simply be passed to the same key handler. This means that
the package author can control how repeatedly setting the same keys is handled.

## The LaTeX lab

There is one more addition to the kernel, but it is mainly aimed at the
adventurous user: `\DocumentMetadata`. On its own, this new command is a simple
place holder,  but we expect it's use to become much more important as we work
on the PDF tagging project further.

This new command has to come first in a LaTeX document, _before_
`\documentclass`. It is used, as the name suggests, to set metadata about the
entire document. This links to the LaTeX lab: a new space to explore ideas
that we think may get added to LaTeX. These experimental ideas are only
activated if the right key is present in the argument to `\DocumentMetadata`.
We currently are in testphase II of the tagging project, which can be activated
using
```
\DocumentMetadata{testphase = phase-II}
```

It is possible that some ideas from the lab will be dropped: anyone using them
should be mindful of that. However, we expect that most will eventually move to
the kernel. Tagging will _always_ require `\DocumentMetadata` to be present, but
over time the need to activate it with the `testphase` key will be removed.

## Outlook

We expect to produce another pre-release around the end of April, which will
give us time to finish the release by June. Please help with the testing

Processing your documents with the pre-release is straightforward. All you have
to do is to replace the invocation command by appending -dev to the executable,
e.g., on the command line you would run
- `pdflatex-dev myfile` or
- `lualatex-dev myfile` or
- `xelatex-dev myfile`
instead of using `pdflatex`, `lualatex` or `xelatex`. If you use an integrated
editing environment, then it depends on the system how to configure it to use an
alternative format; but in any case the necessary modification should be
straightforward.

# Section on documentation reorganized

The site's section on [LaTeX documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/help/documentation/) has been reorganized somewhat: the [list of books]({{site.baseurl}}/help/books/) has been moved to its own page, and the documentation stuff that used to be on the introduction page has been moved to where it belongs. Moreover, a new (French) book has been listed: Fontes et codages by Yannis Haralambous.

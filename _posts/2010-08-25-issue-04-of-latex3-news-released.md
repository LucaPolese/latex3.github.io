# 4th issue of LaTeX3 news released

In late June, the TUG 2010 conference was held in San Francisco to great success. Most of the LaTeX3 project team were able to attend, and for Will it was the first time to meet members of the TeX community face-to-face.

Extra travel plans after the conference meant this news issue has been slightly delayed, but it's now here. For full details on our progress this year see the [LaTeX3 news]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex3-news/) page.

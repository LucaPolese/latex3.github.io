# New LaTeX release

Keeping to our normal non-hasty schedules, the production release for 2005/12/01 is now available on CTAN (after it got somewhat stale during lengthy beta testing).

As usual, information regarding release details can be found in [ltnews17]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews17.pdf) and the file `changes.txt` (containing some technical change info in reverse chronological order).

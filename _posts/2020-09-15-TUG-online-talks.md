# Talks from the online TUG Conference 2020 are now online

The first TUG online conference in July was quite a success with many
interesting talks on many subjects of TeX usage and related topics.
The talks are now appearing one after another on YouTube, thanks to
the the work of a few individuals who have prepared them (and the
question/answer sessions) for publication.

If you have missed the conference (or if you want listen to one of the
talks again) you will find them on the [TeX Users Group Channel on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeXUsersGroup/featured). So far
only a subset of the talks have been added; the remaining ones will
probably appear pretty soon.

There are also several talks by members of the LaTeX Project team. These are:

 - [Frank Mittelbach: Quo Vadis LaTeX(3) — A look at the upcoming
   years](https://youtu.be/zNci4lcb8Vo) which gives an overview about
   our recently started multi-year project that aims at providing
   accessible and tagged PDF;

 - [Joseph Wright: learnlatex.org - Taking online training LaTeX fully
   interactive](https://youtu.be/0qTBtKr-5c0) which gives an overview
   about a project providing interactive online training for new LaTeX
   users;

 - [Marcel Krüger — HarfBuzz in
   LuaLaTeX](https://youtu.be/xPj6vNo8exY) which discusses the
   harfbuzz implementation for LuaLaTeX, its features and usage;

 - [Javier Bezos — in conversation with Paulo Ney de
   Souza](https://youtu.be/aHbO7BUUQqU) which is an interview with the current
   maintainer of Babel.

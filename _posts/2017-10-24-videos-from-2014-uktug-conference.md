## Videos from the 2014 UK-TUG conference available

Somehow those got lost in some email folder of mine, so I'll announce them about three years late. However,
the talks by David and Joseph discuss a number of important topics that are still very relevant, so better late than never:
  + Fixing LaTeX2e -- a new and better plan than using fixltx2e that never worked in practice
  + Reliable Releases: l3build -- a general package and distribution builder for any type of software in the TeX world (not just LaTeX3)
  + Case Changing in the Unicode world -- and the issues related to this.
  
The links to the videos can be found on the project [publication
page]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/) if you scroll down to 2014.

Enjoy -- Frank

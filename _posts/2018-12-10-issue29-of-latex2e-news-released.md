# December 2018 LaTeX release available

We have released the December 2018 LaTeX distribution to CTAN. From
there it will move to the major TeX distributions within a few days.

This release is a maintenance release in which we fixed a number of
older and newer issues. The most important ones are documented in <a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews29.pdf" target="_blank"
onclick="vgwPixelCall('c200b8c6707a4774b6b97cd616a96ced');">"LaTeX2e News Issue 29"</a>. This document
can be found on the [LaTeX2e news
page]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/) where you will also find
release information for earlier LaTeX releases.

### Topics are:

 - Bug reports for LaTeX2e and packages
 - Changes to the LaTeX kernel
 - Changes to packages in the tools category
 - Changes to packages in the amsmath category
 - Website updates

### Bug reporting and compatibility mechanism

We like to take the opportunity to thank everybody who provided
helpful bug reports using the issue tracker that we are now
using. Writing up a good issue report including a clear MWE (Minimal
Working Example) takes some effort, but it is also essential to help
us identifying and fixing issues. Details on how to report bugs can be
found in the article <a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications/2018-FMi-TUB-tb121mitt-bug-reporting.pdf"
target="_blank"
onclick="vgwPixelCall('76c39a7e25524b9a8b93f680f6f20cba');">"New rules
for reporting bugs in the LaTeX core software"</a>. Please consult
this article if you intend to submit a problem.


While I have the stage I would also like to remind package developers and
other interested parties to check out the rollback mechanism for
packages that we introduced already with the last release. The more packages
embrace this approach the better will it work for the users.  Details
on the rollback concept is given in <a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications/2018-FMi-TUB-tb122mitt-version-rollback.pdf"

rollback concept for packages and classes"</a>.

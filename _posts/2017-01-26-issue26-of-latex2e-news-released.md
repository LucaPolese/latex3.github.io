# New LaTeX release --- Issue 26 of LaTeX2e news released 

We have made a new LaTeX distribution with improves the support for
the Unicode engines and has a number of other updates and
improvements. Also important: we now officially require the engines to
support the eTeX primitives in order to build a LaTeX format (all
major engines do that already for a long time).

The most important changes and additions are documented in
ltnews26.pdf. It can be found on the [LaTeX2e news
page]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/).

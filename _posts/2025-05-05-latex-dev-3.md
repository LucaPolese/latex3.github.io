# Final pre-release of LaTeX 2025-06-01 is available for testing

The (hopefully) final pre-release version for the 2025-06-01 LaTeX kernel to
CTAN over the weekend. It's now available for testing in TeX Live, and we'd
like to encourage everyone to try it out.

The focus has been mainly on improving tagging further, with work particularly
on verbatim material and further socket refinement. There's also been some
support work for taggable presentations (more on that perhaps next time!).

Enjoy --- Joseph

# Robin Fairbairns (?? - 2022)



We are sad to report that our long time friend, team member, and LaTeX contributor
Robin Fairbairns died 25th February 2022, after a long period of ill
health.
Much missed husband of Linda, former husband and friend of Josy,
father of Chloe and Sam, stepfather of Chloe and Lydia.

The Funeral will be on [30th March 2022](https://funeral-notices.co.uk/notice/fairbairns/5024136).

Robin was instrumental in bringing the UK TeX archive to Cambridge,
and setting up the CTAN TeX archive network in 1992, of which
Cambridge, DANTE and SHSU were the three original hosts. The UK CTAN
host was managed by Robin until his retirement in 2014.
Robin wrote or maintained many well used [LaTeX packages that are on
CTAN](https://www.ctan.org/author/fairbairns). 

He also regularly served on the UKTUG Committee, and for many
years developed and maintained the "UKTUG FAQ" archive of Questions and Answers on
TeX related subjects.  The FAQ is now maintained at
<https://texfaq.org> but the majority of the text still reflects
Robin's original work.

Robin was one of the seemingly tireless members of the community who was
active in helping as many people as much as he could. He clearly
looked to improve the TeX ecosystem and worked hard to leave it in a
better place after his time was up. He certainly succeeded in that.

With sadness

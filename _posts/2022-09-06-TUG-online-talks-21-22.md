# Talks from the online TUG Conference 2021 and 2022 on YouTube

For some reason it took a long time to get the 2021 talks cut and
uploaded to YouTube and when that finally happened, I was in the
middle of entering copy-editing corrections for the _LaTeX Companion, 3rd edition_ and
simply missed the opportunity to announce the talks and update the
website to refer to it.  Now with TUG 2022 also online this is
more than overdue.

Both conferences (as usual) had quite a number of interesting talks on
many subjects of TeX usage and related topics.  If you have missed the
conferences (or if you want listen to one of the talks again) you will
find them all on the [TeX Users Group Channel on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/TeXUsersGroup/featured).

There were also several talks by members of the LaTeX Project
team. Some are directly relevant to our multi-year project on
automatically producing tagged PDF; others discuss other LaTeX topics
of interest. As an intro to the tagged-PDF project (for those who haven't heard about it yet) I also provide one
link to a talk from the 2020 conference announcing that project.

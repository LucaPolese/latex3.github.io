# New TeXLive.net server & Book Discounts

The [TeXLive.net](https://texlive.net) server that hosts a public [LaTeX service]((https://texlive.net/run) as used at the [learnlatex.org](https://www.learnlatex.org) tutorial site has been upgraded to a new server.

This server is also used by other sites such as [LaTeX Community Forum](https://latex.org/forum/) and [TikZ.net](https://tikz.net/) and the recently advertised [tool to display PDF tagging structure](https://texlive.net/showtags?doc=mathml-AF-ex2-se).

The server has the latest Debian operating system and TeX Live 2025. It  has more memory and more cores available than the previous server.

As before, the virtual machine hosting the service has been kindly provided by Stefan Kottwitz, with support from [DANTE](https://www.dante.de).

To celebrate the update, Stefan has arranged a time limited 15% discount on three of his [LaTeX books](https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/search?q=stefan%20kottwitz&country=us&language=en):

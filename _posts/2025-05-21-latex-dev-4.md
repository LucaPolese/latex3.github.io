# Pre-release 4 of LaTeX 2025-06-01 is available for testing

We [posted a couple of weeks ago](/news/2025/05/05/latex-dev-3/) that a 'final'
development release of the 2025-06-01 kernel had gone to CTAN. A few things
have come up in testing that pre-release, so we have updated again to
pre-release 4. Hopefully that catches the issues without adding new ones -
testing would be much appreciated.

Enjoy --- Joseph

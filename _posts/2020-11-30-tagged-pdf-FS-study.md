# Tagged PDF feasibility study published

At the TUG 2020 online conference we announced the start of a multi-year project to automatically generate tagged PDF with LaTeX, which is an important aspect of producing "accessible" documents. Back then we promised that further information about the project is forthcoming.

We have now added the feasibility study (which was the starting point for the project) to this website:

{% include _papers/paper_2020-FMi-UFi-CAR-tagged-pdf-feasibility.md  %}

In addition the TUGboat article referred to above is also available for reading:

{% include _papers/paper_2020-FMi-TUB-tb129mitt-tagpdf.md  %}


You will find both documents, as well as other documents about the "Tagged PDF Project" and related topics, on the [PDF, Tagging and Accessibility]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/indexbytopic/pdf/) page in the publications area of the site.

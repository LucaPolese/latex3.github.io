# New articles by project members

We have added three articles recently published in TUGboat to the site.

 - Ulrike's article gives a sort overview about the work going on in providing tagged PDF documents,
 - Enrico discusses aspects of mathematical typesetting and
 - Frank's article discusses a new package that implements an improved algorithm for float handling automatically avoiding fairly empty float pages that are common in standard LaTeX documents.

You will find all of them on the [Publications from 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/indexbyyear/2020/) page.

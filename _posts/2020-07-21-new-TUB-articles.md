# New articles by project members

We have added five articles recently published in TUGboat to the site.

 - Enrico discusses aspects of mathematical typesetting,
 - Frank's article discusses a new package that implements an improved algorithm for float handling,
 - Joseph looks a case changing in the Unicode world and the LaTeX3 tools available,
 - Ulrike's article gives a sort overview about the work going on in providing tagged PDF documents and
 - Ulrike and Marcel discuss the use of LuaLaTeX with Harfbuzz in a case study.

You will find all of them on the [Publications from 2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/indexbyyear/2020/) page.

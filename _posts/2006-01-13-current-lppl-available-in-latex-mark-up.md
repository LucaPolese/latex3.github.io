# Current LPPL available in LaTeX mark-up

The [LaTeX project public license (LPPL)]({{site.baseurl}}/lppl/), [version 1.3b]({{site.baseurl}}/lppl/lppl-1-3b/), has been released. It clarifies the issue of derived works intended as a replacement of the original. There's a [LaTeX marked-up version]({{site.baseurl}}/lppl/lppl-1-3b.tex) available, which authors of LPPL software are encouraged to include in their manuals. A [PDF file]({{site.baseurl}}/lppl/lppl-1-3b.pdf) of the license is also provided.

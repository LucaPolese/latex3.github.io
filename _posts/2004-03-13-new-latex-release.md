# New LaTeX release

Who remembers December 23, 1993, when the first public release of LaTeX2e appeared?

The LaTeX3 Project Team wishes to announce the LaTeX 10th Anniversary Release, officially dated December 2003.

It contains numerous changes, additions and improvements â€“ see the news sheets [ltnews15]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews15.pdf) and [ltnews16]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews16.pdf).

As usual, the files can be downloaded from a CTAN mirror near you. This site has an explanation on how to [get LaTeX]({{site.baseurl}}/get/).

# Babel actively maintained again

Babel gets back on track and it is again actively maintained (principal maintainer Javier Bezos). The goals are mainly to fix bugs, to make it compatible with XeTeX and LuaTeX (as far as possible), and perhaps to add some minor new features (provided they are backward compatible). Information on current activities can be found at: [Babel news](https://www.tex-tipografia.com/babel_news.html)

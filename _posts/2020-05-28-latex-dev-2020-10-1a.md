# The first LaTeX prerelease for 2020-10-01 is available for testing

A few days ago we have submitted a new LaTeX development format[^1] to CTAN
and by now it should be available to all users using MiKTeX or TeX
Live (on any operating system).

This format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-10-01 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven't introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problem beforehand, but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we ask for user
testing.

Besides developers we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release candidate, because the more people are testing the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in February hits the streets.

Processing your documents with the prerelease is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
`-dev` to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run

```
pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
```

instead of using `pdflatex`, `lualatex` or `xelatex`. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.



## Main features of the first prerelease for 2020-10-01

We have been quite busy (did Corona help?) and so already this first
prerelease contains close to thirty smaller and larger fixes and
enhancements. A full list is given in a draft version of `ltnews32`
which you should be able to read by running

```
texdoc ltnews32
```

on the command line (or by any other means available at your operating
system---somewhere there should be a file called `ltnews32.pdf` that
you can open with a PDF reader). The draft version is also available from our website as
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews32.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="vgwPixelCall('ae10a427f62847639c5aadcc05cea97b');">LaTeX2e News Issue 32 draft</a>

In this post I only touch two of the most important topics, but many
others are worth exploring too, so please check that documentation out.


### Providing `xparse` as part of the format

In the previous release we added the LaTeX3 programming layer to the
LaTeX format to improve the loading speed when packages using `expl3`
are used (such as `fontspec` or `xparse`). In the upcoming release we
are now extending this support by integrating `xparse` so that the extended
interface for defining document-level commands becomes available out of
the box.

This enables users and most importantly package developers to
easily define LaTeX commands with multiple optional arguments or
other syntax features with ease.
For details, check out the `xparse` documentation, e.g., via `texdoc
xparse`.

### Improving the font series handling

In the previous release we extended NFSS (the new font selection scheme)
to better support modern fonts that offer different font faces, e.g.,
condensed, semi-bold, etc., and make them work seamlessly with each
other. Experiences with the extended interface showed that for some
use cases adequate support was still missing or that in special setups
the algorithms sometimes selected a wrong font series value. These
cases have now been resolved and additional support commands have been
added. For example, with

```
\IfFontSeriesContextTF{〈context〉} {〈true code〉}{〈false code〉}
```

you can now define commands that behave differently depending on the
current font series context. The 〈context〉 to check has to be specified
as either `bf` or `md`. The command then chooses the 〈true code〉
or the 〈false code〉 based on where it is used (e.g., inside
`\textbf` (or `\bfseries`) or not).


## Outlook

We issue the first prerelease now in the hope that you will help by
making sure that all the enhancements and fixes inside are safe and
without any undesired side effects, so please help with the testing if
you can.


We expect further extensions (currently under development) to be added
in a second prerelease, in particular a general hook management system
for LaTeX, so stay tuned.



Enjoy --- Frank

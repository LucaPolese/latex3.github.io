# Videos from the memorial for [Sebastian Sebastian Rahtz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Rahtz) (13.2.1955 - 15.3.2016)

Earlier this year our good friend and colleague Sebastian Rahtz passed
away --- with him the TeX community lost one of its very influencial
members.

On September 27th 2016 the Oxford e-Research Centre hosted a memorial
session for Sebastian at Wolfram College, Oxford titled "SPQR a
digital legacy: what Sebastian Patrick Quintus Rahtz did for us".
Videos of the event have now been made available and they are
certainly worth watching.

Phil Taylor talks about [Sebastian's contributions to the TeX
world](http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/tex-and-latex-software) and Anne
Trefethen reads [a short statement from Don
Knuth](http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/tex-live-don-knuth-remembers-spqr). I
very much enjoyed listening to Joe Talbot's talk about ["What Sebastian Taught
Us"](http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/what-sebastian-taught-us) and [there are
many more presentations that are all worth
watching](http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/sebastian-rahtz-celebration-his-work).

I wrote a short memorial on Sebastian for the Technische Kom√∂die (the
newsletter of the German TeX User's Group (DANTE)). It was also was
also translated to English as a TUGBoat article. Both articles can be
found on the [Publications page]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/).

Sebastian and his legacy will stay with us.

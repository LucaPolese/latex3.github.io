# LaTeX Graphics Companion 2ed is back in print

The LaTeX Graphics Companion 2nd edition, formerly publish by
Addision-Wesely in the "Tools and Techniques for Computer Typesetting"
series, went out of print a while ago. I'm happy to announce that this
has now changed again. Lehmanns Media has picked up the book and produced an
affordable reprint, both as printed softcover book and also as a DRM-free PDF ebook
version:

 - [LaTeX Graphics Companion (softcover)](https://www.lehmanns.de/shop/mathematik-informatik/58611042-9783965433038-the-latex-graphics-companion), ISBN 978-3-96543-303-8 
 - [LaTeX Graphics Companion (ebook)](https://www.lehmanns.de/shop/mathematik-informatik/58574614-9783965432994-the-latex-graphics-companion), ISBN 978-3-96543-299-4

## Update 2022-03-08 (International ordering)

The book should be available from all major bookstores or online ebook providers. The above links point to the Lehmanns
website (which only offers pages in the German language). Internationally, the book can be ordered through Amazon and the like and you find the ebook on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Michel_Goossens_The_LATEX_Graphics_Companion?id=_jhZEAAAQBAJ) or [ciando](https://www2.ciando.com/ebook/bid-3107964-the-latex-graphics-companion-tools-and-techniques-for-computer-typesetting.html) and perhaps on  others.

Happy LaTeXing

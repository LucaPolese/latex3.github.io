# Tutorial on the L3 programming layer (expl3)

In Spring 2020 the LaTeX3 programming language `expl3` was integrated
into the LaTeX format to make it directly accessible to package
developers and for future LaTeX kernel programming. Since that date
LaTeX announces itself with something like

```
LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> patch level 2
L3 programming layer <2020-10-27> xparse <2020-03-03>
```

Up to now the documentation for `expl3` that we provide consists of a
short introduction (`expl3.pdf)`, its reference manual
(`interface3.pdf`) and its source code (`source3.pdf`) all of which you
can easily access using the `texdoc` program, e.g.,

```
texdoc interface3
```

What was missing, however, was a tutorial to help progammers to get
familiar with the features and approaches when they want to use the L3
programming layer in their own packages. Such a tutorial has now been
written by Ziyue “Alan” Xiang, currently a PhD student at Purdue ECE
and we strongly recommend to check it out if you are interested in L3
programming or in understanding code written in it:

Thanks Alan for your work; it is much appreciated!

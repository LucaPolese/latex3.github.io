## Globally optimizing documents with floats

At the TUG/Bachotek conference Frank presented further results (and the
theoretical background) from his work on globally optimizing the
pagination of documents. This is a follow up to the DocEng 2016
article "A Framework for Globally Optimized Pagination".


The slide material and handouts from this tak as well as the earlier
article can be found on the project [publication
page]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/).

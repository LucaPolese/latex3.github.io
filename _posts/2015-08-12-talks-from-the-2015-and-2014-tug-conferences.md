# Talks from the 2015 and 2014 TUG conferences

During the TUG conferences 2014 in Boston and 2015 in Darmstadt we gave a number of talks on several topics related to LaTeX. These are now online as video presentations together with some slide show material.

They cover topics such as

+ 2015
  + LaTeX compatibility policy change (Frank)
  + Unicode math update (Will)
  + Unicode characters in LaTeX (Joseph)
  + \parshape woes (Joseph)
+ 2014
  + l3build a new regression test suite, also available as TUB paper (Frank)
  + Recent development around expl3 and LaTeX3 (Will/Frank)
            
They can be found on the project [article page]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/). Enjoy!

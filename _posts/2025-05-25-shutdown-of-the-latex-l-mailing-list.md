# Shutdown of the LaTeX-L mailing list

Public discussion about LaTeX developments for many years took place on the
LaTeX-L mailing list, hosted by the University of Heidelberg.  However, over
time, active input moved elsewhere, most obviously to [TeX StackExchange
Chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/41/tex-latex-and-friends) for more
informal back-and-forward, and to [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/latex3/latex2e/discussions) for more formal and
archived threads.

We've been removing mentions of LaTeX-L from our documentation and from the website,
as the traffic levels had fallen to the point that the list was no longer sensible
to highlight. The time has now come for the list to be shut down, which won't impact
ongoing work but some long-standing users might want to note.

All the best --- Joseph

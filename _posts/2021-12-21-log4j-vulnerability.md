# log4j vulnerability: LaTeX is not affected!

We are seeing more and more requests asking us whether LaTeX needs a
patch, because of the log4j vulnerability, when the necessary patch is
planned and ready ready, etc. Rather than to explain each time (which
I did more than a dozen times by now) why nothing needs to be done at our end, I
decided to post it here, so that I can refer to that statement.

Upfront I like to apologize to any LaTeX user for the noise, because
if you know what LaTeX is (a macro package running on top of the TeX
program), then you are well aware that such questions are ill
formed. But most people being charged to check all software in use in
their organization do not know each and every piece of software and
for them LaTeX is just a program that may or may not use log4j.

Well, LaTeX is not a program, it is input for a program (namely TeX or
one of its variants) so the question has to be: is any of the TeX
programs that make use of the LaTeX source as input vulnerable to the
log4j issue?

The answer is fortunately a **clear NO** and the official statement for this from
the TeX Users Group organization (for the TeXLive and MikTeX
distributions) can be found here:

- [TeX Users Group home page](https://tug.org/)

In the news blog for the TUG organization you then find:

-  [TUG's statement on the log4j vulnerability](https://tug.org/texlive/cve-log4j.html)

If you talk to people who are searching for an answer whether or not
LaTeX (or rather TeX) is affected by log4j and if so what is being
done about it, please refer them to TUG and that statement.



Happy and continuously safe LaTeXing

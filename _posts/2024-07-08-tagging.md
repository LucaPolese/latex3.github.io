# How to make accessible PDF

The "LaTeX Tagged PDF" project is now advanced enough that more and
more people start using it. We have therefore begun with building
usage documentation that is not scattered across different
repositories as this is the case at the moment.

A while ago we created a dedicated [`tagging-project`
repository](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project) for issues
encountered with the project code.  In this repository people can
report problems and look up the current state of known issues. It is
also hosting discussions related to the project.

We have now extended this repository to use GitHub pages providing a
small [number of web
pages](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/). So far it holds

 - Examples of Tagged PDFs conforming to the
    [WTPDF/PDF/UA-2](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/discussions/72)
    and
    [PDF/UA-1](https://github.com/latex3/tagging-project/discussions/82)
    specifications.

 - Guidelines on [how to produce accessible
   PDF](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/documentation/prototype-usage-instructions.html)
   (describing the current tempoary interfaces)
   
 - [Tables that record the
   status](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/tagging-status/)
   of various packages and classes (i.e., whether or not they can be
   used with the new tagging code) based on the issues that are
   already on record

This documentation and the tables are all work in progress and will
get updated whenever there is new information.


The initial work on the compatibility tables was provided by Ian
Thompson --- thanks for that!  If you want to help improving this,
then this is easily possible.  We are looking for volunteers who try
out the tagging code in various ways and report problems or package
incompatibilites and help with developing tests that prove or disprove
that the tagging code can be used with packages for which we don't
have enough data so far.

# New procedure for reporting LaTeX bugs

The LaTeX Project Team maintains
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?introduction=yes&amp;state=open">a
    bugs database</a> for the core LaTeX software (LaTeX kernel +
packages maintained by the team).
Due to the fact that we get more and more bug reports that we can't
help with (as they are for one of the many third-party packages out
there) we have written a small package that helps with classifying
issues and that identifies the correct addressee for a bug report.
This package should be used in every test file showing a bug prior to
reporting that bug to us.

The new procedure and some helpful information is now described in a
dedicated [bugs page that you find here]({{site.baseurl}}/bugs).

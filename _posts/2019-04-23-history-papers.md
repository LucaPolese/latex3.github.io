# Two papers on the history of LaTeX

We have added two papers on different aspects of the history of LaTeX
to the site.  While both are somewhat older they presents interesting
accounts on the evolution of LaTeX.

The first was given by Chris Rowley at a conference selebrating Leslie
Lamport's 60th birthday and discusses the relvance of LaTeX throughout
several decades (including some interesting predictions be checked
against reality.

The second is an interview carried out by Dave Walden (for the TUG
interview corner) and Gianluca Pignalberi (for the Free Software
Magazine).

We hope that both of them will give you some interesting insights into
the LaTeX evolution.

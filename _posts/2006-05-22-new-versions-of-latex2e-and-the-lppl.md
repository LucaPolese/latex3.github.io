# New versions of LaTeX2e and the LPPL

The December 2005 release of LaTeX2e has been out for a while now. You can get current [LaTeX here]({{site.baseurl}}/get/). Changes from the previous version include updates of required packages, starting the use of eTeX extensions, and the addition of a font encoding guide. See [issue 17 of the LaTeX news]({{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews17.pdf) for details.

Also, some changes have been to the [LaTeX project public license (LPPL)]({{site.baseurl}}/lppl/). The license is now at version 1.3c.

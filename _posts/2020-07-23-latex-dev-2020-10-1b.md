# The second LaTeX pre-release for 2020-10-01 is available for testing

A few days ago we have submitted a new LaTeX development format[^1] to CTAN
and by now it should be available to all users using MiKTeX or TeX
Live (on any operating system).


## Main features of the second pre-release for 2020-10-01

The first pre-release distributed end of May had the following two main
features (beside bug fixes):

- the functionality of the `xparse` package was added directly to the LaTeX kernel
- LaTeX's font series handling was improved

The second pre-release adds one major new component to LaTeX: a general
hook managment system to improve package interoperability and enable
easier customization and extension of LaTeX.

### A general hook management for LaTeX

Most LaTeX users and package writers will know the handful of hooks
that LaTeX offered until now, the most important one perhaps
`\AtBeginDocument`. They are important but far too few so that in many
cases packages developers had to patch directly into internals of LaTeX, with the
all the resulting problems.


With the new hook management system LaTeX will get many more hooks
that packages writers (and authors) can use to add code in a
controlled and reliable way.  There have been a number of places new
hooks have been added using the new system, more will follow over
time. Available now are:
 - Hooks to add code before and after environments (formerly offered through the `etoolbox` package)
 - Hooks used when loading files, packages, or classes (similar to what the `filehook` package provides)
 - Hooks into the page-building process (e.g., functionality previously available through packages such as `atbegshi` or `atveryend` and a few others)

The importance here is not so much that the functionality of these
packages has been integrated into the LaTeX kernel, but that with the
hook management system there is a single structured way to order the
code added by different packages in a reliable way. This will resolve
many of the interoperability issues between packages, which formerly
could only be resolved by loading them in a specific order (if at
all) or by complex and fragile code inside the packages to account
for various scenarios in user documents.

The hook management system is currently documented in three document
(for the final release this will get consolidated):

 - `texdoc lthooks`  --- The description of the interfaces and the core
   hooks already added to the kernel.
 - `texdoc ltshipout` --- The documentation of the hooks available
   during the page production process.
 - `texdoc ltfilehook` --- hooks that can be used before or after a file gets loaded. 

### Other fixes and improvements

A full list of all fixes and additions is given in a draft version of `ltnews32`
which you should be able to read by running

```
texdoc ltnews32
```

on the command line (or by any other means available at your operating
system---somewhere there should be a file called `ltnews32.pdf` that
you can open with a PDF reader). The draft version is also available from our website as
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews32.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="vgwPixelCall('ae10a427f62847639c5aadcc05cea97b');">LaTeX2e News Issue 32 draft</a>.

## Outlook

We expect to produce a third and final pre-release incorporating the
user feedback we receive and consolidating some of the documentation.
A few additional outstanding issues are expected to get fixed as well,
but nothing major --- the main functionality planned for the fall
release is available already now with the second pre-release.





## Please help with the testing

We issue the second pre-release now in the hope that you will help by
making sure that all the enhancements and fixes inside are safe and
without any undesired side effects, so please help with the testing if
you can.

This development format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-10-01 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven't introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problem beforehand, but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we ask for user
testing.

Besides developers we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release candidate, because the more people are testing the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in February hits the streets.

Processing your documents with the pre-release is straight forward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
`-dev` to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run

```
pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
```

instead of using `pdflatex`, `lualatex` or `xelatex`. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straight forward.

[^1]: The internal version number for the pre-release is `LaTeX2e <2020-10-01> pre-release-7`, the first 5 pre-releases just mirrored the patch releases we did for 2020-02-02.

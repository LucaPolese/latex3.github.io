# The second LaTeX pre-release for 2020-10-01 is available for testing

A few days ago we submitted a new LaTeX development format[^1] to CTAN
and by now this should be available to all users using MiKTeX or TeX
Live (on any operating system).


## Main features of the second pre-release for 2020-10-01

The first pre-release, distributed at the end of May, had the following two main
features (beside bug fixes):

- the functionality of the `xparse` package was added directly to the LaTeX kernel
- LaTeX's font series handling was improved

This second pre-release adds one major new component to LaTeX: a general
hook management system to improve package interoperability and enable
easier customization and extension of LaTeX.

### A general hook management system for LaTeX

Most LaTeX users and package writers will know the handful of hooks
that LaTeX has been offering until now, the most important one perhaps
being `\AtBeginDocument`. These are important hooks, but they are far
too few so that in many cases package developers had to directly patch
the internals of LaTeX.  Thus resulted in many problems.


With the new hook management system, LaTeX will get many more hooks
that package writers (and authors) can use to add code in a
controlled and reliable way.  New hooks have been added in a number of
places by using the new system and more will follow over
time. Available now are:
 - Hooks to add code before and after environments (formerly offered
   through the `etoolbox` package);
 - Hooks used when loading files, packages, or classes (similar to
   what the `filehook` package now provides);
 - Hooks in the page-building process (e.g., functionality previously
   available through packages such as `atbegshi` or `atveryend` and a
   few others).

The important point here is not so much that the functionality of these
packages has been integrated into the LaTeX kernel, but that the
hook management system provides a single structured way for different packages 
to reliably add and order 
code.  This will resolve
many of the inter-package interoperability issues which formerly
could be resolved (if at all) only by loading the packages in a specific order, 
or by the use of complex and fragile code inside the packages to account
for various scenarios in user documents.

The hook management system is currently described in these three documents
(for the final release they will be consolidated):

 - `texdoc lthooks`  --- The description of the interfaces and the core
   hooks already added to the kernel.
 - `texdoc ltshipout` --- The documentation of the hooks available
   during the page production process.
 - `texdoc ltfilehook` --- hooks that can be used before or after a file gets loaded. 

### Other fixes and improvements

A full list of all fixes and additions is given in a draft version of `ltnews32`
which you should be able to read by running

```
texdoc ltnews32
```

on the command line (or by any other means available at your operating
system---somewhere there should be a file called `ltnews32.pdf` that
you can open with a PDF reader). The draft version of this file is also available from our website as
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/news/latex2e-news/ltnews32.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="vgwPixelCall('4c0ec6a7a0884b70986328bd5dc816ee');">LaTeX2e News Issue 32 draft</a>.

## Outlook

We expect to produce a third and final pre-release incorporating the
user feedback we receive and consolidating some of the documentation.
A few additional outstanding issues are expected to get fixed as well,
but nothing major --- the main functionality planned for the fall
release is available already now with the second pre-release.





## Please help with the testing

We are issuing this second pre-release now in the hope that you will help us by
making sure that all the enhancements and fixes we have provided are safe and that
they do not have any undesired side effects, so please help with the testing if
you can.

This development format allows you to test the upcoming LaTeX release scheduled
for 2020-10-01 with your documents or packages. Such testing is
particularly important for package maintainers to verify that changes
to the core LaTeX haven't introduced incompatibilities with existing
code. We try to identify any such problems beforehand but such an
undertaking is necessarily incomplete, which is why we are asking for user
testing.

Besides developers, we also ask ordinary users to try out the new
release, because the more people that test the new
format, the higher the chances that any hidden problems are identified
before the final release in October hits the streets.

Processing your documents with the pre-release is straightforward. All
you have to do is to replace the invocation command by appending
`-dev` to the executable, e.g., on the command line you would run

```
pdflatex-dev myfile    or    lualatex-dev myfile    or    xelatex-dev myfile
```

instead of using `pdflatex`, `lualatex` or `xelatex`. If you use an
integrated editing environment, then it depends on the system 
how to configure it to use an alternative format; but in any case the necessary
modification should be straightforward.

<h1>Submit a LaTeX bug report</h1>

<p>Hey, you think you found a bug in LaTeX? Pity! But this page allows you to upload a report to our bugs database.</p>

<h2>Before submitting a LaTeX bug</h2>
<p>Some important hints:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Check that there really is a bug</strong>, by writing a short, self-contained document that shows the problem. You should make sure that the document doesn't use any third-party packages or document classes. If the bug turns out to be with third-party software then please contact the developer, and not us!</li>
  <li><strong>Check to see if the bug has already been reported.</strong> You can do this by searching the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?introduction=yes&amp;state=open">LaTeX bugs database</a>. If the bug has already been reported then there may be a known solution to your problem.</li>
  <li><strong>For bugs related to LaTeX3 code</strong> (expl3, xparse and so on): Do not report the bug here but instead use the <a href="https://github.com/latex3/svn-mirror/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Run LaTeX on the test file.</strong> Send the test file and the resulting transcript file using the form below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you are ready to submit a LaTeX bug report.</p>

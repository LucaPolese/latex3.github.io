## Contributing
Everything you need to know about contributing to this project can be found in the [Contributor Docs](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Requirements
In order to contribute to the website&rsquo;s codebase, you&rsquo;ll need to know a bit about [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and some Command Line-fu. You'll also need to know how to install *[Ruby Gems](https://rvm.io)* and of course have *[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)* installed on your machine.

### Gem Installation
Use the ``bundle`` command to install the necessary gems for the **LaTeX Project**. If you don't have [bundler](http://gembundler.com) installed you'll need to run ``gem install bundler`` before using ``bundle``.

    $ bundle install

## Local Development
Trigger the local server by executing the ``jekyll serve`` task.

    $ jekyll serve

Your local copy will now be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`. Then use `CTRL` + `C` to stop the server.

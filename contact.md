# Contact Details

## Project Team

Please contact the [LaTeX project team]({{site.baseurl}}/about/team/) at <mailto:project-admin@latex-project.org>. This e-mail address should only be used when you want to: 
 
+ invite us for speaking at conferences
+ become a volunteer helper
+ offer consultancy work
+ offer financial support.

Unfortunately we do not have the resources to offer individual help on LaTeX problems and will therefore not reply to emails seeking support. See the help page for ways to get user support.

## Website Team

Please send feedback and bug reports concerning the project web site to <mailto:webmaster@latex-project.org>.

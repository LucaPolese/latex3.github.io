# Procedure to submit a LaTeX bug report

Hey, you think you found a bug in LaTeX? Pity! But this page allows you to upload a report to our bugs database.


## Before submitting a LaTeX bug

A few important preparation steps to go through:

 1. **Check to see if the bug has already been
    reported.** You can do this by searching
    the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?introduction=yes&amp;state=open">LaTeX
    bugs database</a>. If the bug has already been reported then there
    may be a documented workaround for your problem.
 1. **Check that there really is a bug**, by writing a
    short, self-contained document that shows the problem. This file should start with the line
    [`\RequirePackage{latexbug}`]({{site.baseurl}}/bugs/latexbug.sty). Starting with
    this package will help you to
    make sure that the document doesn't use any third-party packages or
    document classes. If the bug turns out to be with third-party
    software then please contact the developer, and not us!
 1. **For bugs related to LaTeX3 code** (expl3, xparse
    and so on): Do not report the bug here but instead use
    the <a href="https://github.com/latex3/svn-mirror/issues">GitHub
    issue tracker</a>.
 1. **Run LaTeX on the test file.** Send the test file
    and the resulting transcript file using the form below.

Now you are ready to submit a LaTeX bug report.

> But please remember: Bug reports sent to us without a
> [`\RequirePackage{latexbug}`]({{site.baseurl}}/bugs/latexbug.sty) line and/or
> containing third-party code flagged by the [`latexbug`]({{site.baseurl}}/bugs/latexbug.sty)
> package are likely to be closed without any
> comment in our bug tracking system!

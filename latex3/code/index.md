# LaTeX3 Development Code

## Obtaining it

Some of the current LaTeX3 development code is held under version control in a SVN repository and can be accessed publicly via a web interface, where it can be downloaded as single files. However, you might prefer to get hold of the files via anonymous SVN access in which case you can get a working copy from the repository at [https://latex-project.org/svnroot/experimental/trunk/](#fixme) using a Subversion client.

Please remember that this material is intended only for experimentation and comments; thus any aspect of it, e.g., the user interface or the functionality, may change and, in fact, is very likely to change. For this reason it is explicitly forbidden to place this material on CD-ROM distributions or public servers. 

## Discussing it

These concepts, as well as their implementation, are under discussion on the list LATEX-L. You can join this list, which is intended solely for discussing ideas and concepts for future versions of LaTeX, by sending mail to <mailto:listserv@URZ.UNI-HEIDELBERG.DE> containing the line

`SUBSCRIBE LATEX-L Your Name`


### Listserv web interface

There exists a [web interface to the
list](https://listserv.uni-heidelberg.de/cgi-bin/wa?A0=LATEX-L) that
can be used to read through the posts sorted by topic and month. By
default this is available to the general public in a read-only
mode. If you like to be post using this interface, you have to be
subscribed to the list and you need to log on (which is an option on
the page).


### Archived posts

This list is archived and, after subscription, you can retrieve older posts to it by sending mail to the above address, containing a command such as:

`GET LATEX-L LOGyymm`

where yy=Year and mm=Month, e.g.

`GET LATEX-L LOG1703`

for all messages sent in March 2017.



### Gmane interface

Gmane also hosted a web interface, including archives, of the LATEX-L
list but this became unavailable after that site changed ownership:
[http://news.gmane.org/group/gmane.comp.tex.latex.latex3](http://news.gmane.org/group/gmane.comp.tex.latex.latex3)

If that state continues much longer we may have to give up hoping and
remove the above link (for now 2017/04) we keep it listed even though
it doesn't work.

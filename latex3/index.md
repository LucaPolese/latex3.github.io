# The LaTeX Project (aka LaTeX3 Project)

The LaTeX project maintains and develops the LaTeX typesetting
system. In a <a
href="{{site.baseurl}}/help/documentation/ltx3info.pdf"
target="_blank"
onclick="vgwPixelCall('51fc82f5083e42e49d51d818c781d70b');">separate
article</a> we provide a more detailed description of what we aim to
achieve and how you can help us to achieve our goals. Some older
reports on the work already done by the project are available from the
Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN). Other work is available from
this site as [articles]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/) (in PDF
format) and information about the current [development code if found
on a separate page]({{site.baseurl}}/latex3/code/).

The experience gained from the production and maintenance of LaTeX2e
(the version you have been using for many years) had a major influence on our
goals for future development and on new code which are now integrated
into LaTeX.

A while ago we made the decision to drop the idea of a separate LaTeX3
that exists in parallel to LaTeX2e, but instead gradually modernizing
LaTeX to keep it competitive in todays world while maintaining
compatibility methods for older documents.

As part of this change of focus the following major improvements have
been introduced during the last years:

 - 2018: Full support Unicode input;  UTF-8 became the encoding
   default for documents;

 - 2019: Introduction of the LaTeX development formats to allow people to
   try out upcoming releases with ease;

 - 2020: Integration of the LaTeX3 programming layer into the LaTeX
     format; first use of this layer: a new general hook management for
     LaTeX; <br>
     Interface extensions to NFSS (The LaTeX font selection
     scheme) to better support modern fonts( OpenType and others).

We also announced at the TUG conference 2020 the start of a multi-year
project (financially supported in parts by Adobe) to make LaTeX
tagging enabled to provide support for "Accessibility" and other
applications that require PDF output with structural information.  See
the [page on accessibility and
tagging]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/indexbytopic/pdf/) for more
details. Updates and status reports will be added in that place when
they become available.

_We are quite excited about this project, because it offers the chance
to make LaTeX unique not just for its unsurpassed quality in math
typesetting, paragraph breaking, etc., but also then its ability to
produce structured documents without manual labor --- so stay tuned on
the progress._

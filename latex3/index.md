# The LaTeX3 Project

The LaTeX3 project is a long-term research project to develop the next version of the LaTeX typesetting system. In a [separate article]({{site.baseurl}}/help/documentation/ltx3info.pdf) we provide a more detailed description of what we aim to achieve and how you can help us to achieve our goals. Some older reports on the work already done by the project are available from CTAN. Other work is available from this site as [articles]({{site.baseurl}}/publications/) (in PDF format) and as [development code]({{site.baseurl}}/latex3/code/).

Until LaTeX3 is delivered, the project team are committed to the active maintenance of _The New Standard LaTeX (LaTeX2e)_. The experience gained from the production and maintenance of The New Standard LaTeX will have a major influence on the design of LaTeX3.

### Contact the LaTeX3 Project Team

The project team can be reached via [e-mail](mailto:project-admin@latex-project.org), but please send general questions about LaTeX, LaTeX use and where to get LaTeX to the usenet news group [comp.text.tex](<news:comp.text.tex>). We don't have the resources to provide an individual answering service for these kinds of questions (or questions regarding future releases of LaTeX).

Our e-mail address should only be used when you want to:

+ invite us for speaking at conferences
+ become a volunteer helper
+ offer consultancy work
+ offer financial support.

## Support LaTeX Development

If you want to support LaTeX development by a donation, the best way to do this is donating to the [TeX Users Group](http://www.tug.org/). They will make sure that your contribution will be used according to your intention. For more information on this, see the [TUG donation page (LaTeX Project Contribution)](http://www.tug.org/donate.html).

# Data Privacy

## Scope

This privacy statement explains to users the nature, extent and purpose, the collection and use of personal data by the responsible provider (The LaTeX Project, see contact page) on this website (referred to as "the offer" below).

The legal basis of data protection can be found in the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG) of the Federal Republic of Germany.

### Access data / Server logs

The provider (or his internet provider) collects access data on each access to the offer (so-called server log files).

The collected access data includes the retrieved Web page name or file, the date and time of access, the transferred data volume, report of successful retrieval, browser type/version, operating system of the user, referrer URL (previously visited page), IP address and the requesting provider.

The provider uses the data for statistical analysis, for the purpose of the operation, safety and optimization of the offer.

However, the provider reserves the right to check the log data later if there is reasonable suspicion of unlawful use due to concrete indications.

### Handling of personal data

Personal information is information that will help to make a person identifiable, i.e., data that can be traced back to a person. This includes the name, email address or telephone number. However, other data such as preferences, memberships or which web pages were viewed by someone can count among personal data.

#### Getting in touch

While contacting the provider (for example, using a contact form or e-mail) the details of the user are stored for editing the request and for the case that follow-up questions arise.

#### Comments and posts

When users leave comments or other contributions, their IP addresses are stored. This is done for the safety of the provider, in case someone writes illegal content in comments and contributions (insults, banned political propaganda, etc.). In this case, the provider may be held responsible even for the comment or post and is therefore interested in the identity of the author.

#### Integration of services and content of third parties

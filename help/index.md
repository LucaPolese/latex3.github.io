# General Help

There are a number of places where you can find help improving your
knowledge of TeX and LaTeX or help for issues with using it; we have
collected some of them on this website for you.

The links below point to material that we think is useful and that we
had a chance to judge for ourselves (because we speak the language and
found the time to look at). There is much more available on the
Internet and in the link section we point to other resources that
offer additional links and material. So the fact that **_we do not
list some resource_** should not be taken as a quality statement that
such material is inferior!

  <section class="col cell1of3">{% include teaser.documentation.html %}</section>
  <section class="col cell1of3">{% include teaser.books.html %}</section>
  <section class="col cell1of3">{% include teaser.links.html %}</section>
</div>

Please note that the **_LaTeX Project does not have enough
resources_** available to manage user support questions directly. We
are just a handful of people working in our free time on maintaining
and developing LaTeX and the user base goes into millions (this site,
for example, sees several thousand hits per day)!

So please **_do not send us individual user questions_**, but use the
available documentation and the TeX community forums where there is a
much better chance for getting fast help if needed.



# Help with Special Problems and Bugs

If you work with a system as powerful and complex as LaTeX you may run
into problems that you can't resolve yourself either because the
documentation you have consulted doesn't offer a solution or perhaps
because you encountered a bug or incompatibility between some
extension package.

In that case it is best to first check within the TeX community by
looking through the [Question and Answer
forums]({{site.baseurl}}/help/links/#question-and-answer-websites) to
see if your problem is already covered there. If it is not covered
post a question in one of those forums. The number of solutions and
recipes on the [Question and Answer
forums]({{site.baseurl}}/help/links/#question-and-answer-websites) are
already huge and growing and people on the TeX forums are generally
very friendly and usually will help you pretty fast.

If the problem doesn't get solved this way then the reason might be
that you have encountered a  genuine "bug". Or perhaps you get a suggested
workaround but people tell you, this is really a bug in package
XYZ. In either case, the next question then is: how can this bug be
resolved?  The first step for this is to report the bug to the
right audience, i.e., the maintainers of the code.

As this is a bigger undertaking and it needs a bit of preparation to
report a bug in a useful way to the right people [we have devoted a
separate page to this; so please continue reading
here.]({{site.baseurl}}/bugs/)


## Website Bugs

If you think you've found a bug on our website you can report it to
the [website team]({{site.baseurl}}/contact/#website-team). If you do
submit a report, thanks for taking the time!

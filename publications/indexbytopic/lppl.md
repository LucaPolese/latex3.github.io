# [Publications by topic]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications/indexbytopic/): LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL)

The LPPL is the license under which the core LaTeX software (and the
majority of the contributed package in the LaTeX World) is
distributed. The license text and additional information is found [on
the LPPL page]({{ site.baseurl }}/lppl/) of this website. The article
below puts the LPPL into historical perspective and explains how and
why it evolved the way it did.

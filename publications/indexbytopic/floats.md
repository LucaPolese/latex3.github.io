+ Published paper, TUGboat volume 35, number 3, 2014

In 2012, a question "How to influence the float placement in LaTeX" was asked on TeX.stackexchange and as there had been many earlier questions around this topic I decided to treat the topic in some depth and explain most of the mysteries that the underlying mechanism poses to people trying to use it successfully. Once my answer appeared on the web, people asked to see this converted into an article and I foolishly replied "only if this answer ends up becoming a `great' answer" (gets 100 votes). At the time of writing this article, the answer stands at 222 votes, so I had better make good on that promise.

+ Translation of the article into Italian language (in ArsTeXnica  in 2015): <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications/arstexnica19-fmi-article.pdf" target="_blank" onclick="vgwPixelCall('f722ab0955c94459bf7cd9e0ef041df4');">Come si puoÌ€ influenzare la posizione degli ambienti galleggianti come figure e table in LaTeX?</a>

+ Published paper, TUGboat volume 34, number 1, 2013

In 1990 shortly after Don Knuth announced TeX 3.0 Frank gave a paper analyzing TeX's abilities as a typesetting engine.
This paper now revisits the findings from more than two decades ago to see  what
has been achieved since then, and perhaps more importantly, what can
be achieved now with computer power having multiplied by a huge factor
and last not least by the arrival of a number of successors to TeX
which have lifted some of the limitations identified back then.
